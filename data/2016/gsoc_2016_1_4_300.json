The majority of the rest of the calls to java.lang.reflect are from the comparators. The number of garbage collections was also significantly reduced. Similarly, by adding handwritten serializer to the POJO word count example could reduce the runtime from 9.5s to 8s on a 100mb input file.

All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BysAfkJVFJ-LXVlA8tRsqC9L_qUmibSINyRN5PEDY-Qwqme4kjYjrwNCuGHmE1OHqGPUv0D9Dz1TLPHJYKWlFdW-h29GgZ0","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"http://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

There you should find a mix of organizational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so please donât be nervous - feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you (although we may be idle for an hour or two when we sleep :) ).  If you prefer email, check out the link to our mailing list or use project@honeynet.org.\n\nWe are looking forwards to hearing from you and hopefully collaborating on something awesome together this summer.","topic_tags":["honeynet","honeypot","security","web development","sandbox"],"technology_tags":["android","machine learning","honeypots","python","html/javascript"],"proposal_tags":["mitmproxy","cuckoo sandbox","rumÄl","yapdns","droidbot","online android sandbox","pcapoptikon","honeypots as a virtualized network functions","conpot","vulnerability emulation for snare and tanner"],"ideas_list":"http://honeynet.org/gsoc/ideas","contact_method":"project@honeynet.org","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":5957583051423744,"display_name":"cle1000","program_year":2016},"abstract":"MITMproxy is a console tool that allows interactive examination and modification of HTTP traffic.

Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large.

The result will facilitate many applications to use the package and switch between backends used to visualize graphs with minimal changes in the code used. `GraphLayout.jl` will be modified to generate an intermediate Geometric Type, similar to what is discussed in this issue in [GeometryTypes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/GeometryTypes.jl/issues/46) using `StructsOfArrays`. Therefore, any backend that supports this type can be used to render graphs.

Running Big Data on Spark ecosystems might be a reasonable way. Its capability to compute data at large scale give us a good solution. However, most of data are unlabeled data; and labeling data not only means highly cost but also requires expertise in that domain.  That is to say, using Supervised Learning algorithms might be unreasonable. In addition, Semi-supervised learning might not be a good way too as for its assumptions need some particular data distributions. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering-based) is a good start step towards this problem. \n       Thus, in this project, I am trying to solve this problem by two phases: retrieving data from Elasticsearch-Hadoop; building a statistical analysis tool on Spark streaming computing from a clustering perspective.

With Pandas readily available for most users, this is tedious fait accompli for users, since the core data model for PySAL's API was designed before Pandas existed. While newer projects have attempted to extend Pandas for geographic data, those packages have difficult-to-install dependencies that make them inaccessible for many end users, and make design decisions which the author thinks are somewhat suboptimal for PySAL's use case. Therefore, I propose to specify and implement a tabular spatial data model in Python leveraging Pandas dataframes directly, rather than through subclassing. This follows in the spatialite idea that spatial data is first data, then spatial. Thus, tooling must focus on enabling spatial operations directly on Pandas dataframes by exploiting column dtype information and dispatching appropriately, instead of a subclassing approach. In the end, this project would result in a simpler data model for PySAL.","assignee_display_names":["Carson Farmer","Philip Stephens"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5191684128243712,"title":"A generic computational framework for biconvex minimization toolbox in R","subcategory":"new package","organization":{"id":6227114235789312,"name":"R project for statistical computing","slug":"r-project-for-statistical-computing","website_url":"https://www.r-project.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","precis":"R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, â¦) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible","description":"R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.

As a whole, it would help beginners to focus more on learning and using new Python packages rather than getting in unavoidable trouble of configuring various paths and configurations in order to install new Python Packages from PyPI.","assignee_display_names":["Harsh Dattani","Terri Oda","lorenzogotuned"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4678025534767104,"title":"A Hybrid Classifier/Rule-based Event Extractor for DBpedia Proposal","subcategory":"nlp","organization":{"id":6523382354935808,"name":"dbpediaspotlight","slug":"dbpediaspotlight","website_url":"http://dbpedia.org","category":"data_and_databases","contact_email":"dbpedia-developers@lists.sourceforge.net","mailing_list":"http://wiki.dbpedia.org/get-involved/mailing-lists","irc_channel":"http://wiki.dbpedia.org/gsoc2016","tagline":"Information Extraction framework from Wikipedia, Wikidata & Commons","precis":"DBpedia is an Information Extraction Framework that pulls data from Wikimedia projects (Wikipedia, Wikidata, Commons) and makes it available on the Web in a structured form.","description":"#### Almost every major Web company has now announced its work on a *Knowledge Graph*: Googleâs *Knowledge Graph*, Yahoo!âs *Web of Objects*, Microsoft's *Satori Graph*, Walmart Labâs *Social Genome*, and Facebookâs *Entity Graph*, just to cite the biggest ones.\n\n# DBpedia\n**DBpedia** is a community-run project that has been working on a **free**, **open-source** Knowledge Graph **since 2006**!\n\nDBpedia currently describes **38.3 million** *âthingsâ* of **685** different *âtypesâ* in **128** languages, with over **4 billion** *âfactsâ*.\nIt is interlinked to many other databases.\nThe knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a technology stack called *Linked Data*, which has been revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web: with Linked Data technologies, all APIs are interconnected via standard Web protocols and languages.\n\n## The Web of Data\nSuch *Web of Data* provides useful knowledge that can complement the *Web of documents* in many ways. See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how **BBC** has created the *World Cup 2010* website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.\n\nOr, more recently, did you see that **IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge**?\n\n# DBpedia Spotlight\n**DBpedia Spotlight** is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that *Spotting*) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that *Disambiguation*).

First I will annotate the named entities in the text using named entity recognition performed by DBpedia Spotlight. Additionally I will annotate the text with Frame Semantics using FrameNet frames. I will then use the collected information, i.e. frames, entities, entity types, with the aforementioned two different methods to decide if the collection is an event or not.","assignee_display_names":["Marco Fossati","Alexandru","swadpasc"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4536016085975040,"title":"A Job Running Client for AcousticBrainz","subcategory":"acousticbrainz","organization":{"id":5864657852039168,"name":"MetaBrainz Foundation","slug":"metabrainz-foundation","website_url":"https://metabrainz.org/","category":"data_and_databases","contact_email":"support@metabrainz.org","mailing_list":"https://community.metabrainz.org/","irc_channel":"https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication/IRC","tagline":"We curate data and make it freely available!","precis":"Umbrella organisation for MusicBrainz, ListenBrainz, AcousticBrainz, CritiqueBrainz, and more *Brainz!","description":"The MetaBrainz Foundation is the caretaker for a number of open source projects, namely:\n\n* [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org): open music metadata database\n* [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org): music file tagger\n* [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/): repository of listen data\n* [AcousticBrainz](http://acousticbrainz.org/): crowd sourced database of acoustic information for music\n* [CritiqueBrainz](https://critiquebrainz.org/): Creative Commons-licensed reviews\n* [BookBrainz](https://bookbrainz.org/): open \"book\" database\n* [MessyBrainz](http://messybrainz.org/): service to deal with unclean metadata\n* [Cover Art Archive](https://coverartarchive.org/): repository of album cover art\n* Event Art Archive: repository of images related to events (e.g., concerts and festivals)","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/32DePufdZTg82pKaKaI6iSMWaxO_Ae1HdehJfVgDs49qoJQbIYErHQosJfTc6WTPdcTo0X98UDtyMllrPWfQuxXcv7rbM6M","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/MetaBrainz","blog_url":"http://blog.musicbrainz.org/","application_instructions":"Please see our detailed instructions for what your application should include here:\n\nhttps://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development/Summer_of_Code/Application_Template","topic_tags":["music","metadata","machine learning","big data","books"],"technology_tags":["python","perl","postgresql","javascript"],"proposal_tags":["musicbrainz","critiquebrainz","listenbrainz","acousticbrainz","musicbrainz picard","bookbrainz","cover art archive","messybrainz"],"ideas_list":"https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development/Summer_of_Code/2016","contact_method":"support@metabrainz.org","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":6147500868108288,"display_name":"Kartik Gupta","program_year":2016},"abstract":"Allowing users to run jobs on their own machines and submit the result.","assignee_display_names":["Alastair"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5784229849858048,"title":"A Modern Deep Learning module","subcategory":"deep learning","organization":{"id":6303577404342272,"name":"OpenCV","slug":"opencv","website_url":"https://github.com/itseez/opencv/wiki","category":"graphics","contact_email":"opencv-gsoc-2016@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2016","irc_channel":"http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2016","tagline":"Open Source Computer Vision and Machine Learning Library","precis":"OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library includes state of the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms and apps.

Our vision is the democratization of media with free networks. Wireless communities implement this idea worldwide.","description":"More and more people are single-handedly installing and maintaining free networks. Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmits data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [HUBS](https://hubs.net.uk/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [B.A.T.M.A.N](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs and then on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with OpenWRT. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. OpenWRT as OS for routers and OLSR, B.A.T.M.A.N and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0aXCPP-Ge7pe5ULzy-odxnbTMvg_zM4uOeCGIQ2iYzhi-Lb2aOvqMn1iseO9wHJBfMCctEGUjTVpiYs6VzhsWyT9EdxQBqo","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117701796212479096817","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

For each such article, the bot aims to accomplish the following tasks:\n(1) Flag passages with facts and statistics which are likely to have become out of date and have not been updated in a given number of years\n(2) Flag phrases which are likely unclear\n(3) Flag bad student edits\n\nFlagged instances are then stored in a database and open to the reviewers for reviewing and closing the flags. A reviewer can decide to either 'Accept' or 'Dismiss' a review item as valid/invalid. Two reviewers decide the fate of each review item, and in the case of a conflict, it is sent to a third reviewer. Reviewer reputation scores are computed based on a mechanism of acceptability of reviews by other peer reviewers. Reviews which lowered the scores can be optionally displayed to the reviewers.","assignee_display_names":["FaFlo","Jim Salsman"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4659144355217408,"title":"AcousticBrainz BigQuery data exploration","subcategory":"acousticbrainz","organization":{"id":5864657852039168,"name":"MetaBrainz Foundation","slug":"metabrainz-foundation","website_url":"https://metabrainz.org/","category":"data_and_databases","contact_email":"support@metabrainz.org","mailing_list":"https://community.metabrainz.org/","irc_channel":"https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication/IRC","tagline":"We curate data and make it freely available!","precis":"Umbrella organisation for MusicBrainz, ListenBrainz, AcousticBrainz, CritiqueBrainz, and more *Brainz!","description":"The MetaBrainz Foundation is the caretaker for a number of open source projects, namely:\n\n* [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org): open music metadata database\n* [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org): music file tagger\n* [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/): repository of listen data\n* [AcousticBrainz](http://acousticbrainz.org/): crowd sourced database of acoustic information for music\n* [CritiqueBrainz](https://critiquebrainz.org/): Creative Commons-licensed reviews\n* [BookBrainz](https://bookbrainz.org/): open \"book\" database\n* [MessyBrainz](http://messybrainz.org/): service to deal with unclean metadata\n* [Cover Art Archive](https://coverartarchive.org/): repository of album cover art\n* Event Art Archive: repository of images related to events (e.g., concerts and festivals)","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/32DePufdZTg82pKaKaI6iSMWaxO_Ae1HdehJfVgDs49qoJQbIYErHQosJfTc6WTPdcTo0X98UDtyMllrPWfQuxXcv7rbM6M","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/MetaBrainz","blog_url":"http://blog.musicbrainz.org/","application_instructions":"Please see our detailed instructions for what your application should include here:\n\nhttps://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development/Summer_of_Code/Application_Template","topic_tags":["music","metadata","machine learning","big data","books"],"technology_tags":["python","perl","postgresql","javascript"],"proposal_tags":["musicbrainz","critiquebrainz","listenbrainz","acousticbrainz","musicbrainz picard","bookbrainz","cover art archive","messybrainz"],"ideas_list":"https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Development/Summer_of_Code/2016","contact_method":"support@metabrainz.org","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":4894651425226752,"display_name":"cetko","program_year":2016},"abstract":"Right now AcousticBrainz is storing summary information to PostgreSQL as jsonb data.

While Lua has no built-in class system, it allows users to construct their own class systems from runtime metaprogramming primitives. Typed Lua, on the other hand, supports a class-definition style based on augmenting Lua's metaprogramming primitives with static type rules. Awkwardly, this style requires the use of metaprogramming primitives in each class definition, and furthermore supports a limited set of class sytem features.\n\nThis project seeks to design and implement a class system for Typed Lua which will replace its current class definition style. It should feel like a cohesive component of the language, rather than a layer on top of Lua's metaprogramming primitives. Because Typed Lua compiles to Lua and is designed to interact with regular Lua code, its code generator should support user-defined plug-ins for compiling Typed Lua class definitions into a specific untyped Lua class system.","assignee_display_names":["Fabio Mascarenhas"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4904227189030912,"title":"Add educational activities to GCompris (In Qt Quick)","subcategory":"applications","organization":{"id":6327828735852544,"name":"KDE","slug":"kde","website_url":"https://www.kde.org/","category":"Other","contact_email":"","mailing_list":"https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-soc","irc_channel":"https://userbase.kde.org/IRC_Channels#Community.2FSupport","tagline":"KDE is an international technology team that creates user-friendly software","precis":"The KDEÂ® Community is an international technology team dedicated to creating a free and user-friendly computing experience.","description":"KDE is an international team co-operating on development and distribution of Free, Open Source Software for desktop and portable computing.

Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.\n\nDrupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

The purpose is only to replace the game\n executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.\n\n ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical\n point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. This year, we're also\n accepting proposals for adding support for classic Role Playing Games (RPGs),\n building on the common ScummVM framework.\n\n ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM and was created in 2003. ResidualVM\n shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a\n mentor.\n\n - ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the\n   Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. To this end, the Virtual Machines\n (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in\n the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a\n very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to\n run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in\n efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30).\n ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers\n (out of an all-time pool of over 110), working together on a codebase of\n 2,400,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer\n contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n - ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play\n   some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D\n adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already\n have their data files.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

It is currently running under Windows, Linux, Solaris, iOS, Android, Embedded Linux, etc.\n\nGPAC recently extended its scope to browsers (Javascript, NodeJS) and modular systems (C++11). GPAC can be used both on client-side or cloud systems.\n\nThe project is intended for a wide audience ranging from end-users or content creators with development skills who want to experiment the new standards for interactive technologies or want to convert files for mobile devices, to developers who need players and/or server for multimedia streaming applications.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ech2-RKzDyekGNe-n4vNnfwANFXtLVZrliPIcaaNB6i2u3aonCTQ4GGyOLP_6gKK8q_S8h-2S1eTFk3Eybxr8cEOSqdUgQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/wearegpac","blog_url":"http://gpac.io","application_instructions":"If you wish to submit a proposal based on these ideas, you may wish to contact the developers and find out more about the particular suggestion you're looking at http://gpac.io/jobs/google-summer-of-code-ideas/.\n\nBeing accepted as a Google Summer of Code student is quite competitive.

Virtio-serial has several limitations though. For example, it does not allow multiple connections to the same port. To overcome this limitations the driver virtio-vsock has been developed.\n\nThe virtio-vsock driver supports the POSIX Sockets API which is more familiar to developers wanting to perform communication between processes. The Sockets API allows N:1 communication and differentiates between block and stream protocols. In addition, programs that already use sockets can easily transition to the virtio-vsock device without major changes in their code.\n\nHowever, the traffic sent through virtio-vsock is hidden to the outside world, as it is internally performed between the hypervisor and the driver. And to facilitate debugging  is important to be able to see this exchange of information. \n\nThe goal of this project is to expose the traffic exchanged through the virtio-vsock socket interface so that programs like Wireshark can capture it. To achieve this, it would be necessary to implement a device driver that exposes the traffic and a Wireshark dissector.","assignee_display_names":["Stefan Hajnoczi"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5055512357896192,"title":"Agent Inspection","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":6083632867311616,"name":"The Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling","slug":"the-center-for-connected-learning-and-computer-based-modeling","website_url":"https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/","category":"languages","contact_email":"feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":null,"tagline":"NetLogo: A language and IDE for programming and scientific simulations","precis":"NetLogo is a programming environment that helps everyday people to do science and programming, helping to improve the lives of students, teachers, and researchers worldwide.","description":"# What Is It?\n\nNetLogo is a programming environment that helps everyday people to do science and programming.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the languageâs scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Javaâs and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: âWeâve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. Itâs reinvigorated the team.â","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/E8D7vgEWmTZy4LsFcyIdb4ZxwrOcQH3mkrbKC4E0TiKrvSlYEs3oU6hJCxTUMqOkSIhI720ty0K03FS4FsU8MSxjWqnQCN4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/scala_lang","blog_url":"http://www.scala-lang.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Your proposal should contain at least the following information, but\nfeel free to include anything that you think is relevant:\n\n*   Please include your name and contact details\n*   Title of your proposal\n*   Abstract of your proposal\n*   Detailed description of your idea including explanation on why is it innovative, what contribution do you expect to make to the Scala community and why do you think your project is needed, a rough plan of your  development and possible architecture sketches.\n*   Description of previous work, existing solutions \n*   Write us about yourself and convince us that you are the right  person for the job (linking to your resume/CV is good but not sufficient)\n    *   Mention the details of your academic studies, any previous work, internships\n    *   Any relevant skills that will help you to achieve the goal?\n    *   Any previous open-source projects you have contributed to?\n    *   Do you plan to have any other commitments during SoC that may affect you work?

Easier for other Infrastructure team members to fix, maintain, or apply updates\n2. Automates by maintaining a single, Ansible-based WordPress install vs. two independent WordPress sites\n3. Creates a standard operating procedure for hosting blog platforms within Fedora (can be used for other extensions in the future)","assignee_display_names":["decause","puiterwijk"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6060091887321088,"title":"Apache Cassandra: Build downgradesstables tool","subcategory":"java","organization":{"id":5694656234913792,"name":"Apache Software Foundation","slug":"apache-software-foundation","website_url":"http://www.apache.org","category":"Other","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"http://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html","irc_channel":"https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC","tagline":"Providing open source software to the public free of charge","precis":"The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache Community of open-source software projects","description":"Established in 1999, the ASF is a US 501(c)(3) charitable organization, funded by individual donations and corporate sponsors.

Yet lack of experimental results makes it hard to convince data engineers to move to Hama. So for this year's GSoC, I am planning to do a performance benchmark against Apache Spark and Flink.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPF4GRQ_Skb1fHvJOPfhnPwYiJGoXSIB-AxPLbukHOIf6S8iFc1TJIRsk3kj8bGwUahwpwhiNHUlO8BjLoE-8E7bgaLVTwg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/103835217961917018533","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Terasology","blog_url":"http://forum.terasology.org/","application_instructions":"See our main GSOC page for instructions and requirements: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/GSOC\n\nIn short we expect intermediate Java skills and that's about it :-)\n\nCome talk to us in the #terasology channel on Freenode IRC or introduce yourself in our forum at http://forum.terasology.org/forum/contributor-introductions.7/","topic_tags":["game","voxel","minecraft","sandbox","modding"],"technology_tags":["java","lwjgl","opengl","blender","gradle"],"proposal_tags":["3d wizardry","architecture","documentation","content","multiplayer","logistics","ai","ui","optimization"],"ideas_list":"https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/GSOC","contact_method":"cervator@gmail.com","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":6001732978999296,"display_name":"Cpt.

If you have extra, not must-have goals (even if they probably won't get done, but can be a part of a further development), please describe them too.\n\n4. What knowledge areas are required to execute on the project? Which areas are you familiar with and which areas you have to improve?\n\n5. Define a time schedule! Define milestones with dates (for example in weekly resolution) - by that you easy split your project into handy tasks, and it also helps us and you to follow the progress, to follow if you are on track or not.\n\n6.

Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform â ideally before, or in the community bonding period â and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\n(4) Get in contact ASAP!\nWe get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\n(5) Read the Ideas Page!\nIf you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page.

We want Matrix to connect together all the various communication services and make them interoperate!","description":"# What is Matrix?\nMatrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.\n\n[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.\n\n# What is Matrixâs Mission?\nMatrixâs initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.\n\nThe longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other, empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.\n\n# What does this mean for users?\nThe aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app & server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.\n\n# How is Matrix currently being used?\n[Lots of different clients](http://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to exiting services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with libpurple or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!\n\nYou can try it yourself by joining a room like [#matrix:matrix.org](https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org) via any Matrix-client - see the  [\"try matrix now\"](http://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) page for suggestions!","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0b70QQe0tbKmEcOkJXu9LGEQPD5CN5i3FKWBNo3g9Q3i8reCIYoH4I8SdyKE1zzcjcCDgUcXZIiGe9j_XeGCcSWJ5iaBoDs","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/communities/113087656528624912834","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg","blog_url":"https://matrix.org/blog/","application_instructions":"The first thing to do, is to have a play with Matrix.

Most hobbyists would want to use simple devices, rather than high end converters with differential serial interfaces, to communicate ( as these high end devices can \nbe expensive ). The typical serial data communication ( simpler SPI, I2C etc ) protocols used for this are somewhat limited in terms of speed, while parallel data communication definitely has an advantage of higher speed data transfers.  As a result there is a need for fast data reading and writing framework for high speed ADCs ( and DACs or others like camera interfaces etc). There might be some non generic  implementation of such a driver, but they have limited usability as they would not be very flexible and in a single unit rather than different reusable modules. As much is the need to have a parallel interfaces, as is the need to have a generic, flexible and reusable implementation of such a subsystem.","assignee_display_names":["SJLC","Abhishek Kumar","m_w","Hunyue Yau"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4978656099172352,"title":"Best responses representation in bimatrix games","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5712469880209408,"name":"Gambit - Software Tools for Game Theory","slug":"gambit-software-tools-for-game-theory","website_url":"http://www.gambit-project.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc-gambit@nash.lse.ac.uk","mailing_list":"","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Software for Analysis of Game Theory Models","precis":"Gambit and its front-end Game Theory Explorer (GTE) allow to create and analyze game theory models as used in economics.

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the \"UIUC\" BSD-Style license.\n\nAmong the sub-projects of LLVM are:\n\n * The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). \n\n * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. \n\n * The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n\n * And many others!\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/yJ4ROVHqt70g4iaMnVIcqq5sgOD3jWkcy1D6kEQllwOPofrIgi8QWvHzWRb8p2HE40PlAgEmBnk0vteEmh8rBbelutjZVW1p","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://blog.llvm.org/","application_instructions":"Students are required to submit their proposals to the corresponding mailing lists (e.g. llvmdev@ for LLVM-related projects, clangdev@ for clang-related, etc) and discuss / refine them before submission to GSoC system.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the languageâs scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Javaâs and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits.\n\nThe projects to which students can contribute span several software projects:  SixTrack, accelerator simulation; the Geant4/Geant-V detector simulation toolkit\nthe ROOT software framework for storing and analyzing the data of the LHC experiments including machine learning software; \nCERNVM, a baseline Virtual Software Appliance for the participants of CERN LHC experiments.\n different computer platforms.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tce30thSPvwrLNLq1Qtpi6QA8Vm9jfoM3wrC_aDAmXMHFRZwlF9Y3vDc1v4BYbI7HWpOJBnPesmZn427Tp-me-EHAL50eix9","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"What to do:\n1.

In recent years, discrete dynamic modeling has emerged as a powerful method of modeling and understanding biological systems. One type, boolean network models (which was initially used as a prototypical model of genetic regulatory networks), has been shown to be a tractable approach for modeling large-systems. A boolean network consists of a set of nodes whose state is binary and is determined only by other nodes in the network through Boolean functions. The simplicity and self-containment of these graphs makes it extremely fast to simulate these systems and is also a very realistic interpretation of how biological networks actually work. Unfortunately, no libraries yet exist for converting a visualization of a biological network into a logic gate visualization and vice-versa.\n\nThus, the aim of this GSoC project is to develop a web-based tool that can visualize biological networks, and also transform these networks into a logic gate-based system.","assignee_display_names":["Bhanwar Lal Puniya","Tom Helikar"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5596826635862016,"title":"Booting the eCos RTOS on the ArchC Simulator","subcategory":"improve existing tool","organization":{"id":6327716429168640,"name":"ArchC","slug":"archc","website_url":"http://www.archc.org","category":"languages","contact_email":"archc@archc.org","mailing_list":"http://www.archc.org/contact.html","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"ArchC is an Architecture Description Language","precis":"ArchC is an Architectural Description Language","description":"ArchC is a powerful and modern open-source architecture description language designed at University of Campinas by the ArchC team in the Computer Systems Laboratory, Institute of Computing.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/S0LbTC0IJvUIZsj95PPGRTOzmm5XDGPkPfBGCOskkjvHz2Xam5UdN1D0gnKQkcf27ICwohgqlG_hC8vH5VX9XxCP7rsXwu99","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Students should send us a text document containing:\n* A brief list of experiences\n* The selected sub-project (you can propose new ones)\n* How do you plan to reach your goal\n* Additional contributions\nWe strongly encorage students to register in our mailing list and discuss this topics with our mantainers.

Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.)

This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you donât want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools.

(2005) and the somatosensory cortical model by the Blue Brain Project (Markram et al., 2015). I propose to create a Python-based package which can generate different configurations of these networks in the NeuroML2 format and initialize the export to different simulation platforms such as NEURON. I can then test several large-scale networks in different simulation platforms providing the analysis on simulation outcomes.","assignee_display_names":["PGleeson"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5181369529401344,"title":"Building Survival Models from Genomic Data with Google TensorFlow","subcategory":"deep learning","organization":{"id":5417632119390208,"name":"Biomedical Informatics, Emory University","slug":"biomedical-informatics-emory-university","website_url":"http://bmi.emory.edu","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"ashish.sharma@emory.edu","mailing_list":"https://gsoc2016-bmi.slack.com","irc_channel":"","tagline":"Big Data for Healthcare and Biomedical Research","precis":"The Emory Biomedical Informatics Department works at the intersection of medicine, machine learning, and high performance computing.","description":"Biomedical Informatics (BMI) is a multidisciplinary field that is motivated by our desire to improve diagnosis, clinical care, and human health, through novel computational approaches to use (and learn from) biomedical and clinical data.

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2016 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Langley Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, SÃ£o Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android.

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the \"UIUC\" BSD-Style license.\n\nAmong the sub-projects of LLVM are:\n\n * The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). \n\n * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. \n\n * The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n\n * And many others!\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.

Sometimes when a solution of sugar and water becomes super-saturated, from it precipitates a pure, delicious, and diabetes-inducing crystal of sweetness, induced by no more than the tap of a finger. So it is today with numeric and visualization libraries for Ruby.\n\nThe [SciRuby project](https://www.sciruby.com) is oriented towards providing computational research infrastructure for the Ruby Programming Language. SciRuby consists of a [fairly large number of gems](https://goo.gl/Ixha2p), including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, daru, and NMatrix.\n\nNMatrix [has been awarded grants](https://goo.gl/zSycrJ) by the [Ruby Association](https://goo.gl/C2Cd3T) in 2012 and 2015, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. [Statsample](https://goo.gl/GTm7qh) and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while [daru](https://goo.gl/DLioLK), [nyaplot](https://goo.gl/pFyO7v) and [gnuplotrb](https://goo.gl/2ttLvk) take care of data analysis and visualization. Nyaplot was also awarded the [Ruby Association Grant in 2014](https://goo.gl/usseDY).\n\nA major portion of our gems have been written by GSoC students â including Nyaplot, daru, plotrb, PubliSci, Ruby-Band, statsample-timeseries, and statsample-glm. Others, like minimization, integration and nmatrix, have been overhauled over the course of Summer of Code projects.\n\nWorking on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz. Further, since we are a science-related project, we expect that successful student projects could lead to publications. Better yet, students might get to see their code go into orbit, or used to save lives in biomedical research.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/LYtk0SbSxCnQmHj-B5T_WtyEdUOiTTzNHW-AaYhfFzWQq6J2SLc5zn_mrWybHo1svfdhYkUtaUO26V6F1S3GIoe81yaSCu4","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+Sciruby","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/SciRuby","blog_url":"http://sciruby.com/blog/","application_instructions":"We expect students to answer a bunch of questions as part of their proposal to SciRuby.\n\nHead over to this link to see the full student proposal guidelines:\nhttps://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/GSoC-2016-Student-Application","topic_tags":["visualization","data","math","science","space"],"technology_tags":["ruby","c programming","jruby","c/c++"],"proposal_tags":["nmatrix","daru","visualization","statsample","api","jruby","guix","space","symengine"],"ideas_list":"https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2016-Ideas","contact_method":"sciruby-dev@googlegroups.com","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":6226348951470080,"display_name":"Lokesh Sharma","program_year":2016},"abstract":"In Data Science acquiring insight from data is what matters and any good data analysis tool must have the key functionalities required to extract information from data.\nNow, itâs needless to say how ubiquitous categorical data is in Data Analysis but they are not currently supported in Daru and operations on them like regression is not supported in Statsample and Statsample-glm.

With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.\n\nSimply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BysAfkJVFJ-LXVlA8tRsqC9L_qUmibSINyRN5PEDY-Qwqme4kjYjrwNCuGHmE1OHqGPUv0D9Dz1TLPHJYKWlFdW-h29GgZ0","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"http://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.\n\nIt's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world.

We provide researchers, students and developers access to state-of-art distributed computer vision and deep learning algorithms as a cloud service through Web Interface & APIs. \n\nA recent World Economic Form report and a New York Times article declared data to be a new class of economic asset, like currency or gold.

Researchers must repeatedly solve the same low-level problems: building & maintaining a cluster of machines, formulating each component of the computer vision pipeline, designing new deep learning layers, writing custom hardware wrappers etc. We are building CloudCV, an ambitious system that will contain algorithms for end-to-end processing of image & video content.

It will do so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500).\n\nDue to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world â from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China âÂ consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has versionâcontrolled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With preâtrained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easyâtoâuse tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/PHSbWWY5uOfqqttU9hYhvF76EfjoLo95Qin9irXjNqns_YGWiNnnh0ZobC-y60lkVIwbGV0S0lsdi2y0XUM_XKEwiuwNN8FX","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/kyle_p_johnson","blog_url":"http://cltk.org/blog","application_instructions":"See our [Project ideas page](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/Project-ideas) for a list of tasks that are suited to three months' work for a beginningâtoâintermediate programmer.

Most work is done in the Python and JavaScript languages, of which a beginner's or intermediate knowledge is expected. Strong experience in another OOP, however, should be adequate too.\n\nIf you know a Classical language that is not yet supported well by the CLTK (e.g., Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese), you may follow the pattern set by the current Greek and Latin libraries. See [the docs](http://docs.cltk.org/en/latest) for an idea of what can currently be done.\n\nFor those not familiar with an ancient language, there are a number of important and challenging projects.

For highly inflected languages like Latin and Greek, the task is particularly important for two reasons: 1. words often have a dozen or more possible forms (and, as opposed to go in English, this is the norm and not only a characteristic of irregularly formed words), and 2. small corpus size in general often demands that counts for a given feature like words be based on the broadest measure possible. Currently available Latin lemmatizers rely largely on dictionary-based look up methods, which is a good solution for frequently occurring and unambiguous forms. For my Google Summer of Code project, I propose to rewrite the CLTK Latin and Greek lemmatizers to handle a higher percentage of forms by applying a backoff tagging approach.","assignee_display_names":["James Tauber","Kyle P.

We are constantly in search of methods to have a 'detection' system as powerful as the human being. Given a random query image, we want to have a system capable of answering the questions like: What is present in the image? Is there a house in it? Is there a human in it? Where is the house located?  Questions like these which are so trivial to human beings, are extremely difficult for a computer - the same computer which is way faster than human beings in terms of sequential calculations and executions. \n\nObjective\n===\n* The library is built with a very specific goal - to answer the fundamental problem of Computer Vision - Object Recognition and Detection.\n* We make available to everyone the existing solution in this direction in a common, intuitive and user-friendly APIs. \n\nWhy OpenDetection? \n===\nFrom the Computer Vision research community, there has been good solutions to very specific tasks; for example, face detection in an image, detection of human beings, or of some objects of very particular kinds (high texture/regular etc.). The methods for solving these different tasks can be very different and highly targeted for that special object type. Because of this reason we have implementation of crude detection/recognition algorithms scattered over different places without any common standard. Even with the availability of dedicated computer vision libraries like OpenCV/PCL, implementation of a simple object detection application based on the existing techniques is not a trivial task as it should be. \n\nThus, the purpose of this library is to contribute in this field and make available the existing solution in this direction in a common, very structured, and a very user-friendly APIs. Every detection algorithm here is as simple as calling a function, and one can fine tune the algorithm changing the configurable parameters.\n\nMore idea: http://opendetection.com/introduction_general.html","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/8JT5di59Kwz0rykku2zdacmtGaTkL-qERT9xGQ4k4J0QHGTic6HmiL2LGOzLaFjGYBr9WJFMHopYjEKXCzach0hZzMnW7w","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Steps\n---\n* Go through the project idea page: http://opendetection.com/idea_list_gsoc2016.html\n* Depending on the project you chose, add your CV to the application highlighting the prerequisites (experiences/education status etc.).\n* Make a proposal with the plan of solving the key tasks with rough timelines. \n* Share it to the google group and to the respective mentors and wait for their comments to refine/update your proposal.\n\nApplication should be done early and go through the mentors for few iterations.

It is a community of contributors from around the world, including volunteers and Red Hat employees, who work with each other to advance the interests of the free culture movement. Everyone is invited to join and, no matter what your skills are, we have a place for you in our community! The Fedora community includes software engineers, artists, system administrators, web designers, writers, speakers, and translators -- all of whom will be happy to help you get started.\n\nFull project description available here: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview\n\nWe believe that all contributors should be excellent to each other.

The grid operators have the possibility to inform the customer about e.g. the current\nenergy price, with this standardized interface. The customer can control his electrical consumers\nregarding the given information. Colibri with the OpenADR connection helps to automate this\nprocess on the customer side. The Colibri control module can reduce or increase the total power\nconsumption depending on to the information from the other smart grid agents. In the end this\nwill result in a more stable grid, because the energy producer and consumer will stand in an\ninterdependency. This also leads to an better usage of the energy resources which is a great benefit\nfor the society.

Examples are, that networks are completely free (all ports are open, all services are enabled, bandwidth is unrestricted) compared to networks with restrictions e.g. no torrent sharing, limited bandwidth and an accepted user agreement that is required.","assignee_display_names":["MarioB","Hpdang"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6052618879107072,"title":"Complete basic cartography suite in GRASS GIS wxGUI Map Display","subcategory":"grass gis","organization":{"id":6273632556810240,"name":"OSGeo - The Open Source Geospatial Foundation","slug":"osgeo-the-open-source-geospatial-foundation","website_url":"http://osgeo.org","category":"Other","contact_email":"info@osgeo.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/soc","irc_channel":"http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/IRC","tagline":"The Open Source Geospatial Foundation","precis":"OSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community.","description":"OSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community in general and several code projects in particular:\n\nWeb Mapping: deegree, geomajas, GeoMOOSE, GeoServer, Mapbender, MapBuilder, MapFish, MapGuide Open Source, MapServer, OpenLayers\n\nDesktop Applications: GRASS GIS, QGIS, gvSIG, Marble\n\nGeospatial Libraries: FDO, GDAL/OGR, GEOS, GeoTools, OSSIM, PostGIS\n\nMetadata Catalogues: GeoNetwork, pycsw\n\nOther incubating projects include: istSOS, PyWPS, Team Engine, ZOO-Project, Opticks, MetaCRS, Orfeo ToolBox (OTB), rasdaman, GeoNode\n\nOther (non-code) Projects: Public Geospatial Data, Education and Curriculum, Live Handout DVD\n\nWe host regional and international FOSS4G conferences with typical attendance of 500-1000+ geospatial developers, industry and government types, and researchers.

If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\n(4) Get in contact ASAP!\nWe get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\n(5) Read the Ideas Page!\nIf you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page.

In such cases unsupervised learning is a great first step beyond simply picking a random tag or the most frequent form according to some corpus statistics.\n\nPart of speech tagging can be improved by combining statistical and rule based methods. In the paper âBoosting Statistical Tagger Accuracy with Simple Rule-Based Grammarsâ, Constraint Grammar is combined with supervised training of a HMM tagger. During tagging, the HMM tagger is only allowed to tag each word with tags the CG has confirmed are valid, rather its superset, the list of all tags allowable for the word form according to a dictionary. This technique seems to have been quite widely adopted in Apertium.\n\nThe current unsupervised tagger training is technically partially supervised. For each word, the set of potential tags (which during training, is the output of the HMM) are limited by whether the tags and word form combination are present in the dictionary. This task will give even more supervision by reducing the amount of ambiguity in these ambiguity sets.","assignee_display_names":["Mikel L.

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you donât want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Donât you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesnât it feel great?

So it is today with numeric and visualization libraries for Ruby.\n\nThe [SciRuby project](https://www.sciruby.com) is oriented towards providing computational research infrastructure for the Ruby Programming Language. SciRuby consists of a [fairly large number of gems](https://goo.gl/Ixha2p), including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, daru, and NMatrix.\n\nNMatrix [has been awarded grants](https://goo.gl/zSycrJ) by the [Ruby Association](https://goo.gl/C2Cd3T) in 2012 and 2015, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. [Statsample](https://goo.gl/GTm7qh) and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while [daru](https://goo.gl/DLioLK), [nyaplot](https://goo.gl/pFyO7v) and [gnuplotrb](https://goo.gl/2ttLvk) take care of data analysis and visualization.

Others, like minimization, integration and nmatrix, have been overhauled over the course of Summer of Code projects.\n\nWorking on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz.

In the long term, we aspire to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\n# Community-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia provides tools that enable teachers, bloggers, professors and enthusiasts to create new explorations without needing to know how to code. Our exploration editor helps creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, and allows the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). We also hope to facilitate the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/afLakFt3BZUUm7NIYqFudc8WU4PqA0t08x6yXaP5Q8yYqQ_0fiz35_ITg_Vdez-T1n72YAcs-7_nYagbTcSPptqHtbjhp4C2","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://oppiablog.blogspot.com/","application_instructions":"# Applying to Oppia\nFirst, we suggest taking a look at our [developer wiki](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki) to become familiarized with our development process.

Cytoscape apps can register commands using annotations, and these commands will then be available in commandTool. Users can execute commands (eg importing networks from file or importing tables) using Command Line Dialog and can see the result in the Reply Log. The commandTool can also execute scripts (each line is  a set of commands) and provide help about command classes and namespaces using the Command API.","assignee_display_names":["Scooter Morris"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5922446842527744,"title":"DAG-based Rendering Pipelines for Terasology","subcategory":"3d wizardry","organization":{"id":4668766554161152,"name":"MovingBlocks","slug":"movingblocks","website_url":"http://terasology.org/","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"cervator@gmail.com","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Using-IRC","tagline":"Terasology: like an open source Minecraft - imagine the possibilities!","precis":"MovingBlocks is a group of open source enthusiasts working on a voxel game platform named Terasology, inspired by Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and more.","description":"## Why Terasology\n\nWe set out to see how an open source and super extensible voxel game inspired by Minecraft could go beyond it and offer gameplay like seen in Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper.

A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPF4GRQ_Skb1fHvJOPfhnPwYiJGoXSIB-AxPLbukHOIf6S8iFc1TJIRsk3kj8bGwUahwpwhiNHUlO8BjLoE-8E7bgaLVTwg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/103835217961917018533","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Terasology","blog_url":"http://forum.terasology.org/","application_instructions":"See our main GSOC page for instructions and requirements: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/GSOC\n\nIn short we expect intermediate Java skills and that's about it :-)\n\nCome talk to us in the #terasology channel on Freenode IRC or introduce yourself in our forum at http://forum.terasology.org/forum/contributor-introductions.7/","topic_tags":["game","voxel","minecraft","sandbox","modding"],"technology_tags":["java","lwjgl","opengl","blender","gradle"],"proposal_tags":["3d wizardry","architecture","documentation","content","multiplayer","logistics","ai","ui","optimization"],"ideas_list":"https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/GSOC","contact_method":"cervator@gmail.com","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":5000689952489472,"display_name":"tdgunes","program_year":2016},"abstract":"DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) pipelines for Terasology, is an extensive refactor of the current rendering engine of Terasology.

The presence of large wood on river sides has positive effects on hydrogeomorphological diversity of habitats and represents a source of organic nutrients in the water. Therefore a compromise should be reached in the management of vegetation (within river corridors and on connected unstable slopes) aiming to reduce flood hazard while preserving its function of large wood supply for river ecosystems.\nThe idea of the project is to develop in gvSIG a model for the evaluation of the hazard derived from large wood transportation during flooding events. The simplified GIS model should consider:\n- the effective presence and characteristics of the vegetation in the inundable river corridors for the log requirement\n- the characteristics of the flow in the stream network for the transportation of the logs downstream.\nWith this model the user will be able to make an analysis of the hazard and risk related to the transport of wood during flooding events on a complete river stream with known and commonly used/available GIS data, using directly in a GIS for displaying input and outputs.","assignee_display_names":["Riccardo Rigon","moovida"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4529407473483776,"title":"Devising the Plasma Mobile Emulator","subcategory":"plasma","organization":{"id":6327828735852544,"name":"KDE","slug":"kde","website_url":"https://www.kde.org/","category":"Other","contact_email":"","mailing_list":"https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-soc","irc_channel":"https://userbase.kde.org/IRC_Channels#Community.2FSupport","tagline":"KDE is an international technology team that creates user-friendly software","precis":"The KDEÂ® Community is an international technology team dedicated to creating a free and user-friendly computing experience.","description":"KDE is an international team co-operating on development and distribution of Free, Open Source Software for desktop and portable computing.

This project proposes to use a more robust and efficient method for automatically denoising diffusion MRI and structural MR datasets, using Local-PCA. Along with an accurate implementation of L-PCA and its adaptation to Rician noise, the project will also aim at optimising the implementation of L-PCA using Cython. \nAfter implementing L-PCA, a method for robust brain extraction needs to be developed. DIPYâs median OTSU based implementation is known not work so well with non-echo planar diffusion imaging (non-EPI dMRI) data. There are few possible ways to improve this, one is to generate labels and have weighted median OTSU. Another idea involves using some version of patch based segmentation using image library constructed from previously annotated images and using it as a reference for the subsequent extraction.","assignee_display_names":["Eleftherios Garyfallidis","Omar Ocegueda","RafaelNH","Julio Villalon"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4900018255298560,"title":"DIPY: Developing a new DIPY website with interactive features","subcategory":"dipy","organization":{"id":4890191244296192,"name":"Python Software Foundation","slug":"python-software-foundation","website_url":"https://www.python.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc-general@python.org","mailing_list":"https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-general","irc_channel":"https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/irc","tagline":"Python is programming language popular among scientists and more.","precis":"Python is a popular programming language among scientists and developers because its libraries help you build quickly.

While young among programming languages, at just over four years since its public release, it's also rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.\n\nJulia's package library is small and still coming of age â but for you, that's a great thing! Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great opportunity to not only build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different!

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the languageâs scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Javaâs and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.\n\nIt's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.\n\nDrupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed.

This year, we're also\n accepting proposals for adding support for classic Role Playing Games (RPGs),\n building on the common ScummVM framework.\n\n ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM and was created in 2003. ResidualVM\n shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a\n mentor.\n\n - ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the\n   Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. To this end, the Virtual Machines\n (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in\n the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a\n very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to\n run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in\n efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30).\n ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers\n (out of an all-time pool of over 110), working together on a codebase of\n 2,400,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer\n contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n - ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play\n   some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D\n adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already\n have their data files.

Among all the available algorithms, phase-shifting profilometry (PSP) is one of the most popular and I believe OpenCV would benefit from its implementation. Unfortunately, PSP does not perform well on dynamic scenes since it belongs to time-multiplexing methods. Indeed, successive patterns are not deformed in the same way which leads to reconstruction errors. To reduce reconstruction errors due to motion, scientists had the idea to combine PSP with Fourier transform profilometry (FTP), a one-shot method that uses the same patterns. My goal for GSoC 2016 is to add PSP, FTP and Fourier assisted phase-shifting profilometry (FAPS) to OpenCV.  Spatial phase unwrapping, which is essential to PSP, FTP and FAPS, will be coded as an independent module due to its broad number of applications. Finally, as a proof of concept of scene understanding from structured light, an automatic piecewise-planar surfaces detection will be tested on the results provided by Fourier transform profilometry.","assignee_display_names":["Delia Passalacqua"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6032728550014976,"title":"Dynamic Topic Models - Gensim","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5706033703944192,"name":"NumFOCUS","slug":"numfocus","website_url":"http://numfocus.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"info@numfocus.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/a/numfocus.org/forum/#!forum/gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"NumFOCUS promotes open source scientific software.","precis":"NumFOCUS is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software.","description":"The mission of NumFOCUS is to promote sustainable high-level programming languages, open code development, and reproducible scientific research.

Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmits data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games.

There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with OpenWRT. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. OpenWRT as OS for routers and OLSR, B.A.T.M.A.N and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0aXCPP-Ge7pe5ULzy-odxnbTMvg_zM4uOeCGIQ2iYzhi-Lb2aOvqMn1iseO9wHJBfMCctEGUjTVpiYs6VzhsWyT9EdxQBqo","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117701796212479096817","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

By taking advantage of the AngularJS framework, EMF Forms provides a web renderer (JSON Forms), which is capable of automatically generating validated forms using just JSON schemata. The creation of those schemata with a text editor is still cumbersome. The goal of this project is to develop a visual editor (the JSON Forms editor), which allows to create the declarative UI descriptions using concepts such as DnD, Live Preview and validation.","assignee_display_names":["Maximilian Koegel"],"program_year":2016}]}
