We represent a network of faculty, students, fellows, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and virtual architects working to identify and engage with the challenges and opportunities of cyberspace.\n\nWe investigate the real and possible boundaries in cyberspace between open and closed systems of code, of commerce, of governance, and of education, and the relationship of law to each. We do this through active rather than passive research, believing that the best way to understand cyberspace is to actually build out into it.\n\nOur faculty, fellows, students, and affiliates engage with a wide spectrum of Net issues, including governance, privacy, intellectual property, antitrust, content control, and electronic commerce. Our diverse research interests cohere in a common understanding of the Internet as a social and political space where constraints upon inhabitants are determined not only through the traditional application of law, but, more subtly, through technical architecture (\"code\").\n\nAs part of our active research mission, we build, use, and freely share open software platforms for free online lectures and discussions. We also sponsor gatherings, ranging from informal lunches to international conferences, that bring together members of our diverse network of participants to swap insights – and sometimes barbs – as they stake out their respective visions for what the Net can become. We also teach, seeking out online and global opportunities, as well as supporting the traditional Harvard Law School curriculum, often in conjunction with other Harvard schools and MIT.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BjUHaaYdORrEuk1QnLyxQcfqnaAlhT9eSzq0km78YHN3U0cBYavWVvAeUhWNvR4vcU4sTBRoz0smJLZD7S-WwrhEuJ47eArn","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/berkmancenter","blog_url":"https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/","application_instructions":"We ask that you please use the Application Template found on our GSoC wiki page here: http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/gsoc/Application_Template.  \n\nThe template has the following required sections:\n\n* Contact information\n* About you\n* Proposal\n- Overview\n- Project Plan\n* Additional Information\n\nWe especially ask that you please make sure that you have looked over the following:\n* Have you reviewed the important dates and times for GSoC 2016?\n* Do you have any significant conflicts with the listed schedule?

These resources consist of language-processing dictionaries and grammars provided by contributors from several countries. Unitex/GramLab is a platform in which you can put linguistic resources, manage them and use them. It is open source, cross-platform, modular, and allows you to deal with languages that use special writing systems (e.g. Arabic and many Asian languages). Some of its functional features stem from its resources: precision, completeness, and ability to handle multi-word units, including through the use of dictionaries and local grammars.\n\nThe dictionaries specify the simple and multi-word units of a language together with their lemmas and a set of grammatical (semantic and inflectional) codes. The availability of these dictionaries is a major advantage compared to the usual utilities for pattern searching: the information they contain can be used for searching and matching, thus describing large classes of words using very simple patterns. The dictionaries are presented in a specific formalism called [DELA](http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=7), internally compiled into a minimal finite state automata, and were constructed by teams of linguists from different countries for several languages: French, English, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German, Arabic, Thai, Korean, Polish, Norwegian, Portuguese.\n\nThe grammars are representations of linguistic phenomena on the basis of recursive transition networks (RTN), a formalism closely related to FST. Numerous studies have shown the adequacy of automata for linguistic problems at all descriptive levels from morphology and syntax to phonetic issues. Grammars created with Unitex/GramLab carry this approach further by using a formalism even more powerful than automata. They are represented as graphs that the user can easily create and update using a visual integrated development environment which is an essential part of the platform.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ISqzrsQkguH6GJisbYVKBbgO-xTK-rSTfZU3glaHwLMwmQXEt2n9RF3DMb73Exu6Ml2zgCkEVqF5IQAKueimVrjj8Xk-OfU","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"In your application, please include the following points:\n\n- Your interest in the problem and your background\n- A description of the problem to be solved\n- The goal of your contribution\n- The approach you plan to implement\n- A list of deliverables\n- Your time schedule\n- Your GitHub username","topic_tags":["natural language processing","local grammars","finite state automata","corpus annotation","multilingual language resources"],"technology_tags":["java","c++"],"proposal_tags":["optimization","core","bytecode","ide","language resource management","multiword units"],"ideas_list":"http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=17","contact_method":"unitex-devel@univ-mlv.fr","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":5634874929053696,"display_name":"Mukarram","program_year":2016},"abstract":"The project aims to improve the functionality of the IDEs by removing interdependency of Unitex and GramLab.

If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\n(4) Get in contact ASAP!\nWe get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\n(5) Read the Ideas Page!\nIf you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page.

The web interface will help the administrators in managing the styles with just a few click without having them to type long commands at shell. This will enhance the overall user experience.","assignee_display_names":["Barry","Terri O","maxking","Florian Fuchs"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5424829905764352,"title":"Proposal for the Apache REEF project","subcategory":"big data","organization":{"id":5694656234913792,"name":"Apache Software Foundation","slug":"apache-software-foundation","website_url":"http://www.apache.org","category":"Other","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"http://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html","irc_channel":"https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC","tagline":"Providing open source software to the public free of charge","precis":"The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache Community of open-source software projects","description":"Established in 1999, the ASF is a US 501(c)(3) charitable organization, funded by individual donations and corporate sponsors.

A slave server  connects to the master and reads the binlog events, then applies the events locally to replicate the same changes as done on the master. A server can be both a master and a slave at the same time, and it is thus possible for binlog events to be replicated through multiple levels of servers.\nA slave server keeps track of the position in the master's binlog of the last event applied on the slave. This allows the slave server to re-connect and resume from where it left off after replication has been temporarily stopped. It also allows a slave to disconnect, be cloned and then have the new slave resume replication from the same master. The MHA tool is a set of perl scripts that assist with automating master failover and slave promotion within short downtime.\nThe goal of this project is to make these scripts understand MariaDB GTIDs such that the new master know what transactions had been applied and which transaction is next.","assignee_display_names":["byte"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5971356743106560,"title":"Proxies in NetworkManager","subcategory":"desktop core","organization":{"id":4994438422069248,"name":"GNOME","slug":"gnome","website_url":"https://www.gnome.org/","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/desktop-devel-list","irc_channel":"https://wiki.gnome.org/Community/GettingInTouch/IRC","tagline":"Ease, comfort and control","precis":"GNOME offers an easy to understand desktop and applications for your GNU/Linux computer.

There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications.

The evaluation part of the current PSYCO implementation shows that the choice of k heavily influences the runtime behavior of PSYCO.

The proposed GSoC project will provide the functionality for a more convenient editing of public transport routes either by creating new ways between stops with a routing algorithm or by replicating them from existing public transport routes. Furthermore, it will elaborate criteria of route correctness and validate the existing routes against those criteria. There are Python scripts written by Polyglot to find ways that belong to a route described by its stops and to compare a given route to an already existing route.

Implementing coroutines will be the main feature of this project, as this feature offers more new methods than the other features. PEP 465 shows that Matrix multiplication is already used more often than bitwise operations in numeric libraries. Also, having coroutines with async and await syntax as well as enhanced unpacking options, the possibility that Python 3.5 syntax will be used in upcoming code rises.

While it is possible to extend some of these models to the case of spatial interaction data, new spatial weight structures will be necessary to capture the unique spatial dependence that occurs between a data point that has both an origin and a destination.

It supports the easy implementation of methods like Finite Elements, Discontinuous Galerkin, Finite Volumes, and Finite Differences.  \nThe underlying idea of DUNE is to create slim interfaces allowing an efficient use of legacy and/or new libraries. Modern C++ programming techniques enable different implementations of the same concept, i.e. grids or solvers,  using a common interface at a low overhead. Thus DUNE ensures efficiency in scientific computations and supports high-performance computing applications.\n\n# People\n\nDUNE developers are professors, graduate students, post-docs, or people working in industry (e.g. as freelancers or consultants), currently located in Germany, UK, and Norway. With DUNE being a scientific software, they all share a scientific education and background. But their background differs (Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics) as well as their application area (flow through porous media, linear elasticity, computational fluid dynamics, electro-magnetism, …).\n\n# History\n\nDUNE started with an inaugurating meeting in February 2002. People from different German research groups of Universities in Bonn, Freiburg, and Heidelberg shared a common interest: developing an clean, slim, and modern open source framework for the parallel solution of PDEs which would allow reusing existent legacy software via a common interface based on generic programming techniques.\n\n# DUNE's main principles\n\n* Separation of data structures and algorithms by abstract interfaces. This provides more functionality with less code and ensures maintainability and extendability of the framework.\n* Static polymorphism allows the compiler to do more optimizations, in particular function inlining, which in turn allows the interface to have very small functions without a severe performance penalty.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/VP1H_FKTvQkXk4LJrndXoR0k3ltKDSslhxwWpLCnyWTE6QP__yAG5sq2e2H1X562NpAAPCqUWAmEG2YUZzsd64lp2kNlibQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"# Proposals\n\nPlease send your proposals to the [dune-devel Mailinglist](http://lists.dune-project.org/mailman/listinfo/dune-devel) and use the tags \"[GSoC2016][Proposal]\" in the subject of the email.

It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.\n\nWhile our work originates from the OpenRISC processor, most of the development went into the processor ecosystem, like the toolchain, operating systems or userspace software. Beside that \"uncore\" hardware components are important to build a System-on-Chip. The focus of the FOSSi Foundation is therefore not on a single processor core, but we work on advancing the entire Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) community. Our main ambition goes into building a community hub: [LibreCores.org](http://www.librecores.org). We currently bring it forward to become the main resource to find open source hardware components and publish such components and their ecosystem.\n\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\n\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\".

The goal of the SageMath foundation is to support the development of the mathematical software system SageMath.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different rings for calculations.

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nBeside this we also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award or the Austrian National Innovation Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org - Beyond one Hour of Code) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years.

In most situations, all mentioned apps share similar/common metadata, which means that same information is duplicated in several places. Even more, in some cases app needs an access to data of another app (for example dashboard app can perform analysis of data stored in event capture application).\nThe aim of this project is to make all of the above mentioned apps share a common (shared) database. Instead of having one database per each app, one app will be implemented with shared database which will store and sync data to the server, while other apps will play a role of clients with UI part only.","assignee_display_names":["Araz Abishov","Erling"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5482394425491456,"title":"RE2 regular expressions in R","subcategory":"new package","organization":{"id":6227114235789312,"name":"R project for statistical computing","slug":"r-project-for-statistical-computing","website_url":"https://www.r-project.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","precis":"R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible","description":"R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made.

In some applications, adjustments to nominal paths must be made based on sensor feedback or operator input. The issues were raised at ROSCON 2015 . The specific application driving this need is robotic assembly using end-effector force feedback, where parts such as computer board components need placement in holes or sockets with tight clearances, and the object locations may vary considerably with a need to locate them using vision systems. Achieving reactive and adaptive path planning may require extensions to several parts of ROS and ROS-Industrial, including the MoveIt! or Descartes path planners, the ROS control layer, or the Simple Message protocol to hardware robot controllers. Development can take place without actual force sensors or cameras, using simulated sources of the high-level outputs of these sensors in terms of small adjustments that affect the trajectories. The key software objective is to put in place a method to adjust trajectories after they have been nominally planned, rather than focusing on sensor processing.","assignee_display_names":["shaunedwards@gmail.com"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4937734745489408,"title":"Real Time Data Access and Visualisation tools.","subcategory":"sunpy","organization":{"id":5650174433034240,"name":"OpenAstronomy","slug":"openastronomy","website_url":"http://openastronomy.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"openastronomy.organization@gmail.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openastronomy","irc_channel":"http://openastronomy.org/contact/","tagline":"Confederation of open source projects in Astronomy","precis":"OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics projects.

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level.  For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body.  These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance.  Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mQrW1ai7kPxsmX7Dv2LHsh_x3h3t9RWf-i33JqVtaoMF1B8SN7AgpCypD6gUrNqf6sicXo9iXRn_wBhb2PUEI2jemSQMz0g","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ChapelLanguage","blog_url":"http://chapel.cray.com/editorials.html","application_instructions":"1.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

Every year, we have to reject a handful of proposals because we cannot locate a suitable mentor.\n * Read the mailing lists. By reading the mailing lists, you'll learn a lot about how the FreeBSD project operates and what kind of people participate.\n * Talk about your idea in public. The freebsd-hackers@freebsd.org mailing list, in particular, is an open forum where many people share ideas about how to improve FreeBSD. By discussing your idea there, you can get feedback that will help improve your proposal and demonstrate that there is interest in your idea.\n * Contribute. Send us a patch! Even if it's not accepted, your patch will show us that you use FreeBSD, have the coding skills we need from GSoC students, and have looked at the source code.

It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.\n\nWhile our work originates from the OpenRISC processor, most of the development went into the processor ecosystem, like the toolchain, operating systems or userspace software. Beside that \"uncore\" hardware components are important to build a System-on-Chip. The focus of the FOSSi Foundation is therefore not on a single processor core, but we work on advancing the entire Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) community. Our main ambition goes into building a community hub: [LibreCores.org](http://www.librecores.org). We currently bring it forward to become the main resource to find open source hardware components and publish such components and their ecosystem.\n\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\n\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware.

When an external contributor uploads a patch for a certain issue, the core developer needs to download the patch and then apply the patch and run the tests manually to make sure it works properly. Also, the core developers review the code on the forked version of Rietveld code review tool which is not being maintained. Once the patch is correct, the changes are committed manually. This is a manual and burdensome process for core developers. On [1st January 2016](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/core-workflow/2016-January/000345.html), Brett Cannon decided to migrate from Mercurial on hg.python.org to Git on GitHub. \n\nSo, my project is about migrating to Git/Github. I will be working on creating pull requests on Github whenever a patch is submitted on the issue tracker (https://bugs.python.org) and integrating various bots to maintain linear history of commits, auto-close of issues, enforce CLA, etc. Towards the end of the GSoC period, I will work on patch-related improvements.","assignee_display_names":["soltysh","Terri Oda"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5195867359281152,"title":"Rperform: performance analysis for R package code","subcategory":"existing package","organization":{"id":6227114235789312,"name":"R project for statistical computing","slug":"r-project-for-statistical-computing","website_url":"https://www.r-project.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","precis":"R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible","description":"R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C/C++ code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system.

There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many thousands more packages are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, and is now fully integrated with markdown, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/coLz5PZ9_dPgJhytiV90STrLwp4kE_a9rXnFfnBzJfhMiYElXyevKIHw7n5sqAI6yy4lDE_zSRtrwqIPtFDckr1XN3uWLA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project that needs a student on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\nnote that some projects may be marked as already having a primary student\n\n2.

Sometimes when a solution of sugar and water becomes super-saturated, from it precipitates a pure, delicious, and diabetes-inducing crystal of sweetness, induced by no more than the tap of a finger. So it is today with numeric and visualization libraries for Ruby.\n\nThe [SciRuby project](https://www.sciruby.com) is oriented towards providing computational research infrastructure for the Ruby Programming Language. SciRuby consists of a [fairly large number of gems](https://goo.gl/Ixha2p), including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, daru, and NMatrix.\n\nNMatrix [has been awarded grants](https://goo.gl/zSycrJ) by the [Ruby Association](https://goo.gl/C2Cd3T) in 2012 and 2015, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. [Statsample](https://goo.gl/GTm7qh) and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while [daru](https://goo.gl/DLioLK), [nyaplot](https://goo.gl/pFyO7v) and [gnuplotrb](https://goo.gl/2ttLvk) take care of data analysis and visualization. Nyaplot was also awarded the [Ruby Association Grant in 2014](https://goo.gl/usseDY).\n\nA major portion of our gems have been written by GSoC students — including Nyaplot, daru, plotrb, PubliSci, Ruby-Band, statsample-timeseries, and statsample-glm. Others, like minimization, integration and nmatrix, have been overhauled over the course of Summer of Code projects.\n\nWorking on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz.

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the \"UIUC\" BSD-Style license.\n\nAmong the sub-projects of LLVM are:\n\n * The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). \n\n * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. \n\n * The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n\n * And many others!\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/yJ4ROVHqt70g4iaMnVIcqq5sgOD3jWkcy1D6kEQllwOPofrIgi8QWvHzWRb8p2HE40PlAgEmBnk0vteEmh8rBbelutjZVW1p","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://blog.llvm.org/","application_instructions":"Students are required to submit their proposals to the corresponding mailing lists (e.g. llvmdev@ for LLVM-related projects, clangdev@ for clang-related, etc) and discuss / refine them before submission to GSoC system.

But LibreOffice goes further by enabling you to use a modern open standard, the OpenDocument Format (ODF).\r\n\r\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates into better compatibility, more utility, and no lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better quality, higher reliability, increased security, and greater flexibility than proprietary alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe community behind LibreOffice is what sets this project apart. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. We invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice even better and accessible to all.\r\n\r\nThe LibreOffice project is hosted and run by the Document Foundation, a charity setup by the community, for the community.

Signaling is also exposed via the core API of Scrapy for use in extensions/middleware. The current signaling mechanism is based on the `pydispatcher` library which although does serve the purpose well often tends to be slower than the actual HTML parsing and tends to bottleneck spiders(see: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/8#issuecomment-112029296). Django, in its 1.0 release refactored the `pydispatcher` code which they claim resulted in a speed improvement of up to 90%, and also simplified the API for better.

There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with OpenWRT. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. OpenWRT as OS for routers and OLSR, B.A.T.M.A.N and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0aXCPP-Ge7pe5ULzy-odxnbTMvg_zM4uOeCGIQ2iYzhi-Lb2aOvqMn1iseO9wHJBfMCctEGUjTVpiYs6VzhsWyT9EdxQBqo","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117701796212479096817","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (http://info.cern.ch), invented by Tim Berners-Lee.

There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits.\n\nThe projects to which students can contribute span several software projects:  SixTrack, accelerator simulation; the Geant4/Geant-V detector simulation toolkit\nthe ROOT software framework for storing and analyzing the data of the LHC experiments including machine learning software; \nCERNVM, a baseline Virtual Software Appliance for the participants of CERN LHC experiments.\n different computer platforms.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tce30thSPvwrLNLq1Qtpi6QA8Vm9jfoM3wrC_aDAmXMHFRZwlF9Y3vDc1v4BYbI7HWpOJBnPesmZn427Tp-me-EHAL50eix9","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"What to do:\n1.

Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.\n\nIt's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.\n\nDrupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed.

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nBeside this we also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award or the Austrian National Innovation Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org - Beyond one Hour of Code) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years.

With Soletta Project's libraries developers can easily write software for devices that control actuators/sensors (I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC, PWM and others) and communicate using standard technologies (OIC, CoAP, HTTP, MQTT, LWM2M, Mavlink and others). It enables adding smartness even on the smallest edge devices.\n\nPortable and scalable, it abstracts details of hardware and OS, enabling developers to reuse their code and knowledge on different targets. The framework has ports done to the following targets:\n * Linux\n * Zephyr OS\n * RIOT OS\n * (Partially) Contiki OS\n\nBy writing a Soletta application, it's a matter of parametrising specific OS values, like GPIO pin numbers and such (Soletta already eases that task) and, with a makefile that builds with the respective toolchains/SDKs, the same application would be functional for all supported targets.\n\nOne of the ways Soletta exposes of writing applications is by flow-based programming (FBP), which allows the programmer to express business logic as a directional graph of nodes connected to type-specific ports.\n\nThe connected node ports will exchange information packets (IP) that will be used to run the flow. The packet can be either empty, used just to trigger an action, or carry a value such as booleans, integers, floats and even complex data types such as blobs. Ports can decide if the packets they produce will be queued or replaced if they were not consumed by target ports when a new packet is to be produced.\n\nFor those used to traditional object oriented programming (OOP) it's like using the observer pattern on source nodes, calling the associated data getter which is then forwarded to target nodes by calling their setter. However this is done by the core in an efficient and safe way as no memory leaks, type mismatch or invalid memory access can happen.\n\nBesides that, Soletta exposes all its functionality on a C API, so that FBP is not mandatory.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ifDN2drTzCdswKo73cM1qwdd4SD88p9I4Jdsi3FM678xcpazUmDyEz50QtL3oiEWcc5TNsq51A1pKXh3BrOqOedR1nLrn5Ph","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Students wishing to apply to help on Soletta must at have at least medium knowledge of the C language, that is used everywhere in the framework.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable.

It supports the easy implementation of methods like Finite Elements, Discontinuous Galerkin, Finite Volumes, and Finite Differences.  \nThe underlying idea of DUNE is to create slim interfaces allowing an efficient use of legacy and/or new libraries. Modern C++ programming techniques enable different implementations of the same concept, i.e. grids or solvers,  using a common interface at a low overhead. Thus DUNE ensures efficiency in scientific computations and supports high-performance computing applications.\n\n# People\n\nDUNE developers are professors, graduate students, post-docs, or people working in industry (e.g. as freelancers or consultants), currently located in Germany, UK, and Norway. With DUNE being a scientific software, they all share a scientific education and background. But their background differs (Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics) as well as their application area (flow through porous media, linear elasticity, computational fluid dynamics, electro-magnetism, …).\n\n# History\n\nDUNE started with an inaugurating meeting in February 2002. People from different German research groups of Universities in Bonn, Freiburg, and Heidelberg shared a common interest: developing an clean, slim, and modern open source framework for the parallel solution of PDEs which would allow reusing existent legacy software via a common interface based on generic programming techniques.\n\n# DUNE's main principles\n\n* Separation of data structures and algorithms by abstract interfaces. This provides more functionality with less code and ensures maintainability and extendability of the framework.\n* Static polymorphism allows the compiler to do more optimizations, in particular function inlining, which in turn allows the interface to have very small functions without a severe performance penalty.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/VP1H_FKTvQkXk4LJrndXoR0k3ltKDSslhxwWpLCnyWTE6QP__yAG5sq2e2H1X562NpAAPCqUWAmEG2YUZzsd64lp2kNlibQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"# Proposals\n\nPlease send your proposals to the [dune-devel Mailinglist](http://lists.dune-project.org/mailman/listinfo/dune-devel) and use the tags \"[GSoC2016][Proposal]\" in the subject of the email.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

Every year, we have to reject a handful of proposals because we cannot locate a suitable mentor.\n * Read the mailing lists. By reading the mailing lists, you'll learn a lot about how the FreeBSD project operates and what kind of people participate.\n * Talk about your idea in public. The freebsd-hackers@freebsd.org mailing list, in particular, is an open forum where many people share ideas about how to improve FreeBSD. By discussing your idea there, you can get feedback that will help improve your proposal and demonstrate that there is interest in your idea.\n * Contribute. Send us a patch! Even if it's not accepted, your patch will show us that you use FreeBSD, have the coding skills we need from GSoC students, and have looked at the source code.

While young among programming languages, at just over four years since its public release, it's also rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.\n\nJulia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great thing!

It does so by systematically exploring as many as possible execution paths in a given program.

These chunks and nodes need to be filtered and reduced to a manageable size for each specific level so as to get optimal performance and less screen clutter.\n\nRendering of higher level tiles can be improved by adding rendering support for roof-types and textures tags of buildings.","assignee_display_names":["Dennis Nienhüser","Torsten Rahn"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5670856382480384,"title":"Support ODF styles in Calc using Orcus","subcategory":"c++","organization":{"id":4911387578990592,"name":"LibreOffice","slug":"libreoffice","website_url":"https://libreoffice.org","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"thb@documentfoundation.org","mailing_list":"https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Mailing_List","irc_channel":"https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Website/IRC","tagline":"LibreOffice is a powerful cross-platform office suite.","precis":"LibreOffice is a thriving project, delivering a complete office suite on desktop and mobile.

LibreOffice embeds several applications that make it the most powerful Free & Open Source Office suite on the market: Writer, the word processor, Calc, the spreadsheet application, Impress, the presentation engine, Draw, our drawing and flowcharting application, Base, our database and database frontend, and Math for editing mathematics.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice is compatible with many document formats such as Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. But LibreOffice goes further by enabling you to use a modern open standard, the OpenDocument Format (ODF).\r\n\r\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates into better compatibility, more utility, and no lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better quality, higher reliability, increased security, and greater flexibility than proprietary alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe community behind LibreOffice is what sets this project apart. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. We invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice even better and accessible to all.\r\n\r\nThe LibreOffice project is hosted and run by the Document Foundation, a charity setup by the community, for the community.

There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with OpenWRT. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. OpenWRT as OS for routers and OLSR, B.A.T.M.A.N and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0aXCPP-Ge7pe5ULzy-odxnbTMvg_zM4uOeCGIQ2iYzhi-Lb2aOvqMn1iseO9wHJBfMCctEGUjTVpiYs6VzhsWyT9EdxQBqo","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117701796212479096817","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

High density of omnidirectional antennae per unit area directly translates to low SNR and thus bad wireless performance of our nodes. In the case where we only control one wireless node, not much can be done. We can scan the surroundings and choose the channel with a maximal SNR. But with a node database system, we can simultaneously optimize the spectrum allocation (both in terms of bandwidth as well as the center frequency, i.e. channel) across different nodes.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

Every year, we have to reject a handful of proposals because we cannot locate a suitable mentor.\n * Read the mailing lists. By reading the mailing lists, you'll learn a lot about how the FreeBSD project operates and what kind of people participate.\n * Talk about your idea in public. The freebsd-hackers@freebsd.org mailing list, in particular, is an open forum where many people share ideas about how to improve FreeBSD. By discussing your idea there, you can get feedback that will help improve your proposal and demonstrate that there is interest in your idea.\n * Contribute. Send us a patch! Even if it's not accepted, your patch will show us that you use FreeBSD, have the coding skills we need from GSoC students, and have looked at the source code.

The idea of this project is to extend Terrain model generation and analysis to practical scenarios, where it would be desirable to have Web-based access to analysis tools (e.g., difference surfaces, mass calculations, inclination analysis) and to model generation functions, using the Triturus library. In the Google Summer of Code program, we shall try to achieve Web-based access for few of these tools. This module will be named ‘terrainTools’ and will be a standalone project.","assignee_display_names":["CDanowski","Benno Schmidt"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5804404598898688,"title":"Test scheduling for large test suites","subcategory":"arquillian","organization":{"id":5944037739593728,"name":"JBoss Community","slug":"jboss-community","website_url":"http://www.jboss.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"gsoc@lists.jboss.org","mailing_list":"https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/JBossGSoCContactInformation","irc_channel":"https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/JBossGSoCContactInformation","tagline":"Community of Java projects around JBoss Middleware","precis":"JBoss Community is a community of open source projects primarily written in Java.","description":"JBoss Community is a community of open source projects.

Each of these models define a set of input parameters which determine the features of the output. With enough of these outputs we can begin to perform what is known as reconstructing the black box in the field of parameter space analysis (Konyha et al.). One method to do this is through trial and error, where a researcher sets the input parameters to specific values based upon their experience, and collects the outputs as sample points to investigate later on (Sedlmair et al.). This is a computationally expensive method for exploring parameter space which limits the effectiveness of the program overall.\n\nThis project represents an effort to update the Parameter Space Exploration (PSE) tool so that it can be used effectively for exploring the parameter space associated with each included large-scale brain model. This achieved would effectively reconstruct the black box of the model which is vital for our understanding of its validity, and supports ongoing work to better understand the original basis for our model, the human brain.","assignee_display_names":["Lia"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6323674634256384,"title":"Theano : Better handling of larger graphs and faster optimization phase during compilation","subcategory":"other","organization":{"id":4890191244296192,"name":"Python Software Foundation","slug":"python-software-foundation","website_url":"https://www.python.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc-general@python.org","mailing_list":"https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-general","irc_channel":"https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/irc","tagline":"Python is programming language popular among scientists and more.","precis":"Python is a popular programming language among scientists and developers because its libraries help you build quickly.

CERN is one of the world’s largest and most exciting centers for fundamental physics research. Experiments at CERN have probed the fundamental nature of matter and the forces which affect it. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (http://info.cern.ch), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the world’s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits.\n\nThe projects to which students can contribute span several software projects:  SixTrack, accelerator simulation; the Geant4/Geant-V detector simulation toolkit\nthe ROOT software framework for storing and analyzing the data of the LHC experiments including machine learning software; \nCERNVM, a baseline Virtual Software Appliance for the participants of CERN LHC experiments.\n different computer platforms.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tce30thSPvwrLNLq1Qtpi6QA8Vm9jfoM3wrC_aDAmXMHFRZwlF9Y3vDc1v4BYbI7HWpOJBnPesmZn427Tp-me-EHAL50eix9","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"What to do:\n1.

These resources consist of language-processing dictionaries and grammars provided by contributors from several countries. Unitex/GramLab is a platform in which you can put linguistic resources, manage them and use them. It is open source, cross-platform, modular, and allows you to deal with languages that use special writing systems (e.g. Arabic and many Asian languages). Some of its functional features stem from its resources: precision, completeness, and ability to handle multi-word units, including through the use of dictionaries and local grammars.\n\nThe dictionaries specify the simple and multi-word units of a language together with their lemmas and a set of grammatical (semantic and inflectional) codes. The availability of these dictionaries is a major advantage compared to the usual utilities for pattern searching: the information they contain can be used for searching and matching, thus describing large classes of words using very simple patterns. The dictionaries are presented in a specific formalism called [DELA](http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=7), internally compiled into a minimal finite state automata, and were constructed by teams of linguists from different countries for several languages: French, English, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German, Arabic, Thai, Korean, Polish, Norwegian, Portuguese.\n\nThe grammars are representations of linguistic phenomena on the basis of recursive transition networks (RTN), a formalism closely related to FST. Numerous studies have shown the adequacy of automata for linguistic problems at all descriptive levels from morphology and syntax to phonetic issues. Grammars created with Unitex/GramLab carry this approach further by using a formalism even more powerful than automata. They are represented as graphs that the user can easily create and update using a visual integrated development environment which is an essential part of the platform.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ISqzrsQkguH6GJisbYVKBbgO-xTK-rSTfZU3glaHwLMwmQXEt2n9RF3DMb73Exu6Ml2zgCkEVqF5IQAKueimVrjj8Xk-OfU","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"In your application, please include the following points:\n\n- Your interest in the problem and your background\n- A description of the problem to be solved\n- The goal of your contribution\n- The approach you plan to implement\n- A list of deliverables\n- Your time schedule\n- Your GitHub username","topic_tags":["natural language processing","local grammars","finite state automata","corpus annotation","multilingual language resources"],"technology_tags":["java","c++"],"proposal_tags":["optimization","core","bytecode","ide","language resource management","multiword units"],"ideas_list":"http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=17","contact_method":"unitex-devel@univ-mlv.fr","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":4557016227905536,"display_name":"aleksandrachasch","program_year":2016},"abstract":"TreeCloud is a project for visualizing the word occurences of the text in a form of the tree with words as leaves.

LibreOffice embeds several applications that make it the most powerful Free & Open Source Office suite on the market: Writer, the word processor, Calc, the spreadsheet application, Impress, the presentation engine, Draw, our drawing and flowcharting application, Base, our database and database frontend, and Math for editing mathematics.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice is compatible with many document formats such as Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. But LibreOffice goes further by enabling you to use a modern open standard, the OpenDocument Format (ODF).\r\n\r\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates into better compatibility, more utility, and no lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better quality, higher reliability, increased security, and greater flexibility than proprietary alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe community behind LibreOffice is what sets this project apart. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. We invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice even better and accessible to all.\r\n\r\nThe LibreOffice project is hosted and run by the Document Foundation, a charity setup by the community, for the community.

Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project.

Does it sound far fetched? Check out our [exemplifying demo][https://github.com/AltraMayor/XIA-for-Linux/wiki/An-exemplifying-demo].\n\nEstablished in 2010, the XIA project is a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University, Boston University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA is developed at Boston University (BU) under the supervision of Computer Science Professor John W. Byers, one of the principal investigators of the XIA project. Michel Machado developed Linux XIA as part of his Ph.D. thesis, and continues the development as a visiting researcher at BU. The team at BU also includes the Ph.D. students Cody Doucette and Qiaobin Fu.\n\nThe suggested projects that we have in our ideas list this year cater to students proficient in C programming, and comfortable with advanced data structures.

Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.\n\nJulia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great thing! Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great opportunity to not only build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different!

By building a package with a common interface to these frameworks , the same code that was written on OS X linking against Accelerate, can automatically be run *without modification* on Windows linking against Intel's VML, and can automatically be run *without modification* on Linux linking against Yeppp!. When a call is made to a function defined by Vectorize.jl, the fastest implementation available on the current Julia installation (from each of the three frameworks above, which may or may not be installed) is dispatched. In addition to providing access to these three vectorization libraries, Vectorize.jl also aims to define a macro, @vectorize, that attempts to make accessing these vectorized functions easier. The primary functionality of this macro would be to enable scalar functions to automatically be mapped to vectorized equivalents within Julia, i.e. `@vectorize sum([log(x) for x in X])` should automatically be mapped to vectorized function equivalents.","assignee_display_names":["Jameson","Simon Byrne","archdrobison@gmail.com"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6532286853939200,"title":"Verifying Safety of NextGen Models","subcategory":"jpf application domains","organization":{"id":5791763432210432,"name":"Java Pathfinder Team","slug":"java-pathfinder-team","website_url":"http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/","category":"languages","contact_email":"jpf.gsoc@gmail.com","mailing_list":"http://groups.google.com/group/java-pathfinder","irc_channel":"https://webchat.freenode.net/","tagline":"JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine built for sofware verification","precis":"JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine which is written in Java, and is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from model checkers to test case generators.","description":"The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999.

JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2016 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Langley Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android.

One requirement for NextGen is to provide a better, at least the same, level of safety system, compared to the current ATS (Air transportation System). Using the Brahms Multi Agent System Modeling framework, researchers at NASA and the FAA are building models describing actions of flight and ground staff. These models are being explored to find better ways to coordinate to keep planes in the air, as well as how to land them quicker and safer.\n\nWithin those models, the Java Pathfinder tool has been used to verify properties related to safety and workload. This verification process suffers from the (in)famous state space explosion problem: for the large model it is not possible to do complete state space exploration. \n\nIn this proposal we propose to use  the GALE optimizer (GALE is a fast heuristic algorithm which can find the optimal result to the multi-objectives problem by pruning the unpromising subspace) to find the most promising sub-state space in the models so that the verification process can be targeted and more efficient.","assignee_display_names":["Franco Raimondi","neharungta","Eric Mercer"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4636324141203456,"title":"Vert.x Eventbus clients for Python,C#, C, and Rust applications","subcategory":"vert.x","organization":{"id":6170617833324544,"name":"Vert.x","slug":"vertx","website_url":"http://vertx.io","category":"languages","contact_email":"vertx-enquiries@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vertx","irc_channel":"http://freenode.net/","tagline":"Vert.x is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM.","precis":"Vert.x is an open source project to build reactive, highly concurrent applications on the Java Virtual Machine.","description":"Vert.x is a polyglot event-driven application framework that runs on the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nThe application framework includes these features:\n\n* Polyglot.

JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2016 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Langley Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android.

With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.\n\nSimply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BysAfkJVFJ-LXVlA8tRsqC9L_qUmibSINyRN5PEDY-Qwqme4kjYjrwNCuGHmE1OHqGPUv0D9Dz1TLPHJYKWlFdW-h29GgZ0","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"http://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

We use real world applications to drive the development of the runtime system, coining out required functionalities and converging onto an stable API which will provide a smooth migration path for developers.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

Unfortunately scaling existing computer vision algorithms to large datasets leaves researchers repeatedly solving the same algorithmic and infrastructural problems. Our goal is to democratize computer vision; one should not have to be a computer vision, big data and deep learning expert to have access to state-of-the-art distributed computer vision algorithms. We provide researchers, students and developers access to state-of-art distributed computer vision and deep learning algorithms as a cloud service through Web Interface & APIs. \n\nA recent World Economic Form report and a New York Times article declared data to be a new class of economic asset, like currency or gold. Visual content is arguably the fastest growing data on the web. Photo-sharing websites like Flickr and Facebook now host more than 6 and 90 Billion photos (respectively). Besides consumer data, diverse scientific communities (Civil & Aerospace Engineering, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, and Astrophysics, etc) are also beginning to generate massive archives of visual content, without necessarily the expertise or tools to analyze them.\n\nMoreover, designing and implementing efficient and provably correct computer vision algorithms is extremely challenging.  Researchers must repeatedly solve the same low-level problems: building & maintaining a cluster of machines, formulating each component of the computer vision pipeline, designing new deep learning layers, writing custom hardware wrappers etc. We are building CloudCV, an ambitious system that will contain algorithms for end-to-end processing of image & video content. Users will be able to upload their own code and convert it into a cloud service with minimal effort so that anybody can implement, use or just play around with the algorithm online or through API endpoints without having to worry about infrastructural and implementation related issues.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/b5aE1heANWFsgcf7hzWSU7Afrr37t5nNnom91gOvCohlxy3YlE2G7s768I0YXSE9pnksLTBvtnjseUUNN-FDD3UMkGnobRE","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Steps Toward a Successful Application\n\n- Find An Idea That Interests You\nBefore you even start, it's important that you find a project that excites you.

The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.\n\nWhile our work originates from the OpenRISC processor, most of the development went into the processor ecosystem, like the toolchain, operating systems or userspace software. Beside that \"uncore\" hardware components are important to build a System-on-Chip. The focus of the FOSSi Foundation is therefore not on a single processor core, but we work on advancing the entire Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) community. Our main ambition goes into building a community hub: [LibreCores.org](http://www.librecores.org). We currently bring it forward to become the main resource to find open source hardware components and publish such components and their ecosystem.\n\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\n\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\". Please find a list of a few [ideas](http://fossi-foundation.org/gsoc16-ideas.html), and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Bologna, Italy, on October 7-9.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5PutHlYkCsWgipHrrhfJQD0yConZgx_alejMN-jsQDzf6MTHFjRENTGg1mwqXZnCiDTKiE3y98Wm1oZAgQpLTqueQQXF770","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+FossifoundationOrg42","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/FossiFoundation","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"The application process starts with making yourself known to the prospective mentor if you are applying for one of our ideas.

You should try to interest a potential mentor for your project, by contacting us at [gsoc@fossi-foundation.org](mailto:gsoc@fossi-foundation.org).\n\nThe student proposal should answer the following the questions:\n * What is your motivation to participate? Why did you choose FOSSi?\n * Have you been active in the FOSSi community before?\n * What prior projects did you complete in the required area (if any)?\n * What is the main outcome of your summer project? How is that of use to the FOSSi community?\n * What is your detailed timeline to reach the goal? What are measurable milestones?\n * Are there any obstacles to the timeline?

Basic patches exist in the ChromiumOS branch, but further work needs to be done.\n\n* Support for Multiple Status Registers\n* Support for OTP/Security Registers\n* Add Support for EEPROMs\n\nInvestigate changes arising in the core infrastructure (including libflashrom) and produce mergeable code that is sustainable.\n\n* Common Flash Interface (CFI)\n\nGive flashrom the ability to auto-detect chips with CFI capability (similar to auto-detecting SFDP-capable chips).","assignee_display_names":["dhendrix","stefanct"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4859676533456896,"title":"‘aima-python’ code to accompany the book “AI: A Modern Approach”","subcategory":"python","organization":{"id":5187704870404096,"name":"aimacode","slug":"aimacode","website_url":"https://github.com/aimacode/","category":"languages","contact_email":"peter@norvig.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/aima-talk/info","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Code to accompany the book \"AI: A Modern Approach\"","precis":"We need help writing solid, understandable code to match the pseudocode in the book \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\".","description":"We need help writing solid, understandable code to match the pseudocode in the book \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\".
