Since 2011, we have completed more than 400 bioinformatics analysis projects with over 290 distinct groups of researchers across Canada. Our teams have significant experience in personalized medicine applications. These have included genome analysis and interpretation of personal genomes, technology and services to record patient presentations, RNA- and ChIP-seq data analysis, and analysis of complete human epigenomes in both germline disorders and cancers.

This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags).

There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source.

While young among programming languages, at just over four years since its public release, it's also rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.\n\nJulia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great thing! Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great opportunity to not only build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different!

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be used to build them.\n\nLLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the \"UIUC\" BSD-Style license.\n\nAmong the sub-projects of LLVM are:\n\n * The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). \n\n * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. \n\n * The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n\n * And many others!\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/yJ4ROVHqt70g4iaMnVIcqq5sgOD3jWkcy1D6kEQllwOPofrIgi8QWvHzWRb8p2HE40PlAgEmBnk0vteEmh8rBbelutjZVW1p","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://blog.llvm.org/","application_instructions":"Students are required to submit their proposals to the corresponding mailing lists (e.g. llvmdev@ for LLVM-related projects, clangdev@ for clang-related, etc) and discuss / refine them before submission to GSoC system.

JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2016 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Langley Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android.

Moreover, some apps cannot be properly analyzed in this way, as they rely on system events, make native calls, or interact with other Android apps that are unavailable outside the platform.\n\nWe propose an alternative approach: to create a fork of JPF and its extensions for Android platform. We plan to create an Android app that includes all sources of jpf-core, with necessary modifications, wrapped in the user interface (UI). The UI will start main method of underlying jpf-core, provide to it command line arguments, and display output.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: “We’ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code.

Then the existing compilation pipeline can be reused to produce JavaScript code from the IR. The key to this project is that, as complex as it may be, it would reuse a lot of great code.

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

It supports various tile shapes like square, hexagonal, isometric square. Tiled support in KivEnt will be a very useful tool, given that Tiled is already a very famous and feature-rich platform for creating game worlds and maps. A game developer would appreciate getting to use Tiled to create worlds with kivy than some custom platform in-built into KivEnt. This will also make it easier (at least the map part) for people to port their existing games to KivEnt, from other platforms which use Tiled.\n\nThe aim of this project is to create a fully-functional Tiled module which supports almost all features which Tiled currently supports, i.e. various types of tile shapes, tile animations, multiple layers, shape definitions in tiles, custom data etc. The project will also require a TMX file format loader/parser.","assignee_display_names":["Akshay Arora","Kovak","Tito"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5647926659383296,"title":"Knitting Machines","subcategory":"fashiontec","organization":{"id":6245880424300544,"name":"FOSSASIA","slug":"fossasia","website_url":"http://fossasia.org","category":"Other","contact_email":"contact@fossasia.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fossasia","irc_channel":"http://fossasia-slack.herokuapp.com/","tagline":"Open Technologies for Social Change","precis":"The aim of FOSSASIA is to develop open technologies for social change in Asia and around the world.

People rarely understand how is it produced and perceived. The naive perception is often that speech is built with words, and each word consists of phones. The reality is unfortunately very different. Speech is a dynamic process without clearly distinguished parts. It's always useful to get a sound editor and look into the recording of the speech and listen to it.\nAll modern descriptions of speech are to some degree probabilistic. That means that there are no certain boundaries between units, or between words. Speech to text translation and other applications of speech are never 100% correct. That idea is rather unusual for software developers, who usually work with deterministic systems. And it creates a lot of issues specific only to speech technology.\nThe system is intended to develop Language model and Acoustic model to be used for speech recognition of Malayalam Language.","assignee_display_names":["Deepa P Gopinath"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6437352587132928,"title":"Large scale image viewing/editing module in 3D Slicer","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":6330542282768384,"name":"Stony Brook University Biomedical Informatics","slug":"stony-brook-university-biomedical-informatics","website_url":"https://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stonybrookbmigsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Biomedical Informatics at Stony Brook University","precis":"The Department of Biomedical Informatics at Stony Brook University delivers innovative informatics technologies to enhance biomedical research and healthcare delivery.","description":"The Department of  Biomedical Informatics (BMI) is the home of biomedical informatics research and education at Stony Brook University.

Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

You'll need to work closely with a FreeBSD developer who is willing to act as your GSoC mentor. If you can find a developer who is willing to commit to helping you, that is a big boost. Every year, we have to reject a handful of proposals because we cannot locate a suitable mentor.\n * Read the mailing lists. By reading the mailing lists, you'll learn a lot about how the FreeBSD project operates and what kind of people participate.\n * Talk about your idea in public. The freebsd-hackers@freebsd.org mailing list, in particular, is an open forum where many people share ideas about how to improve FreeBSD. By discussing your idea there, you can get feedback that will help improve your proposal and demonstrate that there is interest in your idea.\n * Contribute. Send us a patch! Even if it's not accepted, your patch will show us that you use FreeBSD, have the coding skills we need from GSoC students, and have looked at the source code.

The music is first written in a text format; Lilypond then processes the file to output a graphical representation.\n\nDue to limitations in Lilypond's input syntax, one class of notational devices, spanners (e.g. slurs), are implemented with the assumption that they must start and end in the same voice. However, it is often desirable to have spanners start and end in different voices; in fact, any music that involves multiple simultaneous voices may use such notation.\n\nPresently, getting Lilypond to produce spanners between voices is not impossible, but requires an awkward workaround using a hidden voice. Although this works, it requires users to artificially add \"music\" that isn't actually there to compensate for a limitation of Lilypond. This project aims to develop a semantically clear and less confusing method of inputting cross-voice spanners.","assignee_display_names":["Jan-Peter"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6242789314527232,"title":"Lint For Apertium","subcategory":"improving the engine","organization":{"id":5353061883052032,"name":"The Apertium Project","slug":"the-apertium-project","website_url":"http://wiki.apertium.org","category":"social_communications","contact_email":"apertium-contact@lists.sourceforge.net","mailing_list":"https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/apertium-stuff","irc_channel":"http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/IRC","tagline":"A free/open-source rule-based machine translation platform","precis":"Free/open-source rule-based machine translation platform","description":"Apertium is a free/open-source machine translation platform, initially aimed at related-language pairs (such as Spanish–Catalan)  but which has been expanded to deal with more divergent language pairs (such as English-Catalan).

But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\n(2) Be appropriate\nDemonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\n(3) Have a plan\nThree months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\n(4) Get in contact ASAP!\nWe get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\n(5) Read the Ideas Page!\nIf you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page.

We want all needed hardware functionalities to be enabled in software but also, either from performance of security reasons, the number of unnecessary modules to be minimal. The configuration system provides several methods of achieving this goal either by generating a default configuration or by letting the user select the needed drivers but, by far the most interesting solution is the automated disabling of unused modules with localmodconfig configuration. \n\nLinux Kernel backports are a solution to provide drivers released on newer kernels to be available for usage on older kernels. APIs and data structures change over time but drivers should provide functionality in any case. \n\nThis project aims to add support for Linux Kernel backports in already existing configuration option, localmodconfig.  The goal is to automatically determine the available functionalities not only from the drivers provided by the current kernel version but also from all the backported ones. Extensions of this project could fill some gaps in upstream Linux.","assignee_display_names":["Luis Rodriguez","Rostedt"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6240040917139456,"title":"List Of Contributors","subcategory":"extensions","organization":{"id":5813448017444864,"name":"Wikimedia Foundation","slug":"wikimedia-foundation","website_url":"http://wikimediafoundation.org/","category":"Web","contact_email":"wikitech-l@lists.wikimedia.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l","irc_channel":"http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wikimedia-dev","tagline":"A global movement with a mission to bring free educational content to the world","precis":"Wikimedia is a global movement, bringing in free educational content to the world through its projects, chapters, and the support structure of the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation.","description":"**We believe that knowledge should be free for every human being.** We prioritize efforts that empower disadvantaged and underrepresented communities, and that help overcome barriers to participation.

The two constructs introduced in Rogas  are: CLUSTER-BY and RANK-BY, which play an important role in analyzing the topological structure that lies beneath based entities and relationships. However, local community search queries are still needed in Rogas framework. In a local community search query, the objective is to find the communities that are associated with a given set of query vertices. Implementation of local community search functionality needs careful modeling into NAER model as well.\n\nThe proposed project aims at adding the local community search functionality into Rogas. This makes Rogas a more general framework that covers a broader range of network analytics applications. Moreover, this project aims at implementing and instantiation of three local community detection techniques chosen from the state-of-the-art ones in the field of network analytics. This can bring Rogas a new level of functionality with a more detailed coverage of network analytics applications.","assignee_display_names":["Qing"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6605865897426944,"title":"Loklak apps/microservices to the open tweet platform loklak.net and IoT integrations using the loklak backend","subcategory":"loklak","organization":{"id":6245880424300544,"name":"FOSSASIA","slug":"fossasia","website_url":"http://fossasia.org","category":"Other","contact_email":"contact@fossasia.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fossasia","irc_channel":"http://fossasia-slack.herokuapp.com/","tagline":"Open Technologies for Social Change","precis":"The aim of FOSSASIA is to develop open technologies for social change in Asia and around the world.

The purpose is only to replace the game\n executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.\n\n ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical\n point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. This year, we're also\n accepting proposals for adding support for classic Role Playing Games (RPGs),\n building on the common ScummVM framework.\n\n ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM and was created in 2003. ResidualVM\n shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a\n mentor.\n\n - ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the\n   Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. To this end, the Virtual Machines\n (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in\n the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a\n very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to\n run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in\n efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30).\n ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers\n (out of an all-time pool of over 110), working together on a codebase of\n 2,400,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer\n contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n - ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play\n   some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D\n adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already\n have their data files.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C/C++ code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many thousands more packages are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, and is now fully integrated with markdown, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/coLz5PZ9_dPgJhytiV90STrLwp4kE_a9rXnFfnBzJfhMiYElXyevKIHw7n5sqAI6yy4lDE_zSRtrwqIPtFDckr1XN3uWLA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project that needs a student on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\nnote that some projects may be marked as already having a primary student\n\n2.

In the long term, we aspire to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\n# Community-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia provides tools that enable teachers, bloggers, professors and enthusiasts to create new explorations without needing to know how to code. Our exploration editor helps creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, and allows the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). We also hope to facilitate the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/afLakFt3BZUUm7NIYqFudc8WU4PqA0t08x6yXaP5Q8yYqQ_0fiz35_ITg_Vdez-T1n72YAcs-7_nYagbTcSPptqHtbjhp4C2","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://oppiablog.blogspot.com/","application_instructions":"# Applying to Oppia\nFirst, we suggest taking a look at our [developer wiki](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki) to become familiarized with our development process.

Oppia currently requires users to be connected to the internet at all times while playing explorations. Furthermore, Oppia sends quite a lot of data across the network while playing explorations or visiting the website in general. Both of these have a negative effect on the user experience on the site, and are likely to make Oppia difficult or impossible to use for many users who are visiting it on poor connections.\n\nThe first part of this project involves allowing some explorations to be played without an internet connection. This is a multi-step problem. Most of these now happen in the frontend, however, there are still a few aspects of the communication between the frontend and backend that need to be changed in order to allow offline playing.\n\nThe second part of this project is decreasing the amount of data Oppia sends between the backend and frontend. Oppia was not originally written with mobile or poor internet connections in mind.

Umbrella Sampling (US) is an MD technique which involves performing a series of simulations in which a ‘reaction coordinate’ – such as distance between two molecules – is restrained to different values. Simulation data can be combined, usually using the WHAM method, to produce a ‘potential of mean force’ (PMF) profile that shows the energy landscape along the chosen coordinate. Several implementations of WHAM exist, but require input files of specific formats which may differ from that obtained directly from the simulation, dependent on the simulation engine used. Additionally, it would be convenient be able to calculate the PMF alongside analysis of the trajectory such as offered by MDAnalyisis. However, MDAnalysis does not yet have tools specifically for dealing with and analysing US simulations. This project aims to introduce capabilities for loading US simulation sets, including a generalised tool for loading auxiliary data files, and performing WHAM and other basic analysis.","assignee_display_names":["Jonathan Barnoud","mnmelo","Richard Gowers","Max Linke"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5278944697778176,"title":"Memory Safety","subcategory":"improve quality","organization":{"id":6231425443430400,"name":"Scilab Enterprises","slug":"scilab-enterprises","website_url":"http://www.scilab.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc@lists.scilab.org","mailing_list":"http://mailinglists.scilab.org/Scilab-GSOC-Mailing-Lists-Archives-f2646148.html","irc_channel":"http://www.scilab.org/resources/user_community/irc","tagline":"Numerical computation IDE for engineering and scientific applications","precis":"Scilab is free and open source software for numerical computation providing a powerful computing environment for engineering and scientific applications.","description":"Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions.

Overall, we strongly encourage early contact as it will allow for improved team bonding as well as drafting of the application-relevant documents, and will aid the mentors in judging the student's suitability. Also, our projects will provide 'puzzles', which the student is supposed to tackle and submit along with the application. \n\nWe strongly discourage applications without ever contacting the respective mentors, even more so when this is done close to the submission deadline. In such cases, we will be extremely skeptical about the students intentions, especially concerning the student's ability to work in a team.

Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BysAfkJVFJ-LXVlA8tRsqC9L_qUmibSINyRN5PEDY-Qwqme4kjYjrwNCuGHmE1OHqGPUv0D9Dz1TLPHJYKWlFdW-h29GgZ0","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"http://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

However, one of the areas lacking in functionality is the moduli space. We say two self-maps of projective space are equivalent if there is an element of the Projective Linear Group that conjugates one to the other. The following two algorithms should be implemented, in order to create more functionality in moduli space.\nThe first algorithm would be that given two endomorphisms of projective space determine if they are conjugate. In other words, determine if they are in the same class in the moduli space. If they are, also return the PGL element that conjugates one to the other.The second algorithm would be that given an endomorphism of projective space to compute a reduced form. This conjugation would that makes the coefficients small. There is already an algorithm implemented to return the minimal model in terms of resultant, but the coefficients can be non-optimal. The simplest approach would be to reduce the binary form describing the fixed points or if the binary form describing the fixed points is not sufficiently nice then reduce the binary form for points of period n for some small n.","assignee_display_names":["Benh"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6618091286953984,"title":"Monitoring and quality assurance of open wifi networks: the client view","subcategory":"monitoring","organization":{"id":5681906590941184,"name":"Freifunk","slug":"freifunk","website_url":"http://freifunk.net","category":"social_communications","contact_email":"info@freifunk.net","mailing_list":"http://wiki.freifunk.net/Mailinglisten","irc_channel":"http://irc.freifunk.net","tagline":"Freifunk is a non-commercial initiative for free and open wireless networks.","precis":"freifunk is part of a global movement for free infrastructure.

One recent method for addressing this problem is sampling regions based on low-resolution features (i.e. texture, boundaries) for extracting information about the tissue. Moreover, this method can also help with speeding up the processing, since after cropping the proposed regions, the problem would be turned into a tractable learning problem.","assignee_display_names":["cooperle"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5020968707686400,"title":"Multi-view Reconstruction with Witness Camera for Blender","subcategory":"motion tracking","organization":{"id":4788963764076544,"name":"Blender Foundation","slug":"blender-foundation","website_url":"http://www.blender.org","category":"graphics","contact_email":"foundation@blender.org","mailing_list":"http://lists.blender.org/mailman/listinfo/bf-committers/","irc_channel":"http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Community:Chat","tagline":"We make a 100% free/open source 3D creation pipeline.","precis":"Blender is the free/open source 3D creation software for everyone, providing individuals and small teams a complete pipeline for 3D graphics, modeling, animation and games.","description":"Blender is being made by 100s of active volunteers from all around the world; by studios and individual artists, professionals and hobbyists, scientists and students, vfx experts and animators, and so on.\n\nAll of them are united by an interest to have access to a fully free/open source 3D creation pipeline.

There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

Since RISC-V is a base ISA, having a myHDL based implementation becomes a essential and would enable a lot of Computer Architecture researchers to design and test RISC-V based derivatives using myHDL and python based utilities.","assignee_display_names":["Christopher","Oscar Diaz"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6064064329416704,"title":"MyHDL : GEMAC Implementation","subcategory":"myhdl","organization":{"id":4890191244296192,"name":"Python Software Foundation","slug":"python-software-foundation","website_url":"https://www.python.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc-general@python.org","mailing_list":"https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-general","irc_channel":"https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/irc","tagline":"Python is programming language popular among scientists and more.","precis":"Python is a popular programming language among scientists and developers because its libraries help you build quickly.

While many solvers are currently found in ODE.jl, there are still many which are awaiting a native Julia implementation in the package. In particular, there is a lack of implicit solvers implemented in ODE.jl (currently, there is only one implicit solver: ode23s). Such solvers are important because they are especially suited for solving stiff ODEs, which are very common. In light of this, the first goal of my proposed project is a native implementation of implicit solvers RADAU and MEBDFI. Further, in order to reliably use ODE.jl, a robust initial value problem (IVP) testing suite for ODE.jl solvers is a necessity. Work has has been started towards this end through the development of IVPTestSuite.jl. Though, there are many improvements to IVPTestSuite.jl which could be made, especially in improving the ODE solver performance tracking. Thus, the second goal of my proposed project is to advance IVPTestSuite.jl and its surrounding documentation.","assignee_display_names":["mauro3","Jiahao Chen"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4947701330345984,"title":"Native Scilab Kernel for Jupyter","subcategory":"new feature","organization":{"id":6231425443430400,"name":"Scilab Enterprises","slug":"scilab-enterprises","website_url":"http://www.scilab.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc@lists.scilab.org","mailing_list":"http://mailinglists.scilab.org/Scilab-GSOC-Mailing-Lists-Archives-f2646148.html","irc_channel":"http://www.scilab.org/resources/user_community/irc","tagline":"Numerical computation IDE for engineering and scientific applications","precis":"Scilab is free and open source software for numerical computation providing a powerful computing environment for engineering and scientific applications.","description":"Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions.

Also,\nsince dealing with archives is actually dealing with files, the user will be able to do\nthis from the file manager.\n\nFrom the developer’s perspective, moving archive support to a library will\nallow for compression and decompression to be handled internally by applications.\nThis aims to reduce the usage of file-roller so it can eventually be removed as an\napplication.","assignee_display_names":["Cosimo Cecchi","Carlos Soriano"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5116283246870528,"title":"Near Duplicate Detection in Medical Image Archives Proposal","subcategory":"data fusion","organization":{"id":5417632119390208,"name":"Biomedical Informatics, Emory University","slug":"biomedical-informatics-emory-university","website_url":"http://bmi.emory.edu","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"ashish.sharma@emory.edu","mailing_list":"https://gsoc2016-bmi.slack.com","irc_channel":"","tagline":"Big Data for Healthcare and Biomedical Research","precis":"The Emory Biomedical Informatics Department works at the intersection of medicine, machine learning, and high performance computing.","description":"Biomedical Informatics (BMI) is a multidisciplinary field that is motivated by our desire to improve diagnosis, clinical care, and human health, through novel computational approaches to use (and learn from) biomedical and clinical data.

Our vision is the democratization of media with free networks.

Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmits data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [HUBS](https://hubs.net.uk/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [B.A.T.M.A.N](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs and then on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with OpenWRT. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. OpenWRT as OS for routers and OLSR, B.A.T.M.A.N and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0aXCPP-Ge7pe5ULzy-odxnbTMvg_zM4uOeCGIQ2iYzhi-Lb2aOvqMn1iseO9wHJBfMCctEGUjTVpiYs6VzhsWyT9EdxQBqo","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117701796212479096817","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

In other words, the goal is to decouple the device management functionality from netifd to other separately maintained device managers to allow both sides to evolve independently. Moreover, the decoupling will allow netifd to manage devices of types which may even be unknown to netifd without the need to change the central UCI network device configuration in /etc/config/network. In this project, we will present a basic proof-of-concept module which outsources the control over Open vSwitch in OpenWrt to an external device handling entity. Specifically, we will realize a small daemon acting as a relay between the ovs command line tools and netifd's ubus device handler interface. Native support of Open vSwitch in OpenWRT will open a wide range of different use-cases.","assignee_display_names":["JULIUS"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5621545615491072,"title":"Netlink socket parsers","subcategory":"netlink parser","organization":{"id":5106770607341568,"name":"strace","slug":"strace","website_url":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/strace/","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"","mailing_list":"https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/strace-devel","irc_channel":"","tagline":"linux syscall tracer","precis":"strace is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional system call and signal delivery tracer.","description":"strace is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional userspace tracer for Linux.

CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (http://info.cern.ch), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the world’s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits.\n\nThe projects to which students can contribute span several software projects:  SixTrack, accelerator simulation; the Geant4/Geant-V detector simulation toolkit\nthe ROOT software framework for storing and analyzing the data of the LHC experiments including machine learning software; \nCERNVM, a baseline Virtual Software Appliance for the participants of CERN LHC experiments.\n different computer platforms.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tce30thSPvwrLNLq1Qtpi6QA8Vm9jfoM3wrC_aDAmXMHFRZwlF9Y3vDc1v4BYbI7HWpOJBnPesmZn427Tp-me-EHAL50eix9","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"What to do:\n1.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C/C++ code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many thousands more packages are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, and is now fully integrated with markdown, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/coLz5PZ9_dPgJhytiV90STrLwp4kE_a9rXnFfnBzJfhMiYElXyevKIHw7n5sqAI6yy4lDE_zSRtrwqIPtFDckr1XN3uWLA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project that needs a student on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\nnote that some projects may be marked as already having a primary student\n\n2.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

Most of it is carried out by scientists who need to tweak their tools in order to get their experiments to run, and almost none of it is shared. To reduce the need for such redundant development efforts, we created Open Ephys as a centralized hub for tool sharing. \"Ephys\" is short for \"electrophysiology,\" which is the most common technique for recording the activity of neurons. Our main focus is on making it easier for neuroscientists to acquire data from many neurons simultaneously, and the Open Ephys GUI is the open-source, modular application that makes this possible. Our GUI, which takes inspiration from audio production software such as Ableton Live, is the most widely used open-source application of its kind.

Distribution of models in the form of open-source modules is needed to initiate freer discourse in the scientific world, where the development of interdisciplinary fields has served to the end of establishing specificity of focus instead of fostering a more holistic and collaborative approach to investigation.\n\nThe McGill Space Institute (MSI) is an organization located at the crossroads of astronomy, biology, and earth sciences, embodying an archetype characterized by transparency, sharing, and collaboration: facets reflected in open-source culture. By developing three pieces of code for a model of an important microbial metabolism, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, we can meet the interests of MSI researchers from all walks. \n\nIn making a single core model available to these three sub-groups of workers in formats that are compatible with their existing working methods and languages of choice, it is possible to set a precedent in the encouragement of transdisciplinary collaboration in science.","assignee_display_names":["Boz"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4578792932638720,"title":"OpenADS - On the fly insights from the elasticsearch data stream","subcategory":"improvement","organization":{"id":4814166095298560,"name":"Sustainable Computing Research Group ( SCoRe )","slug":"sustainable-computing-research-group-score","website_url":"http://www.scorelab.org/","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"info@scorelab.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/score-community","irc_channel":"http://www.scorelab.org/IRC.html","tagline":"SCoRe has conducted research covering various aspects of Security, Mobile & IOT.","precis":"SCoRe at University of Colombo School of Computing is a research lab that seeks sustainable solutions for various problems developing countries like Sri Lanka face.","description":"The Sustainable Computing Research Group (SCoRe) at UCSC has conducted research covering various aspects of wireless sensor networks, embedded systems, digital forensic, information security, mobile applications and e-learning.

There is a recent trend to integrate aspects of both disciplines, commonly by \"adding types\" to languages originally designed as dynamic.\n\nThere has been interest in the Ruby community to explore such an approach: Yukihiro Matsumoto devoted his keynote at RubyConf 2014 to the potential implementation of static typing in the language. The topic is complex: a Ruby tightly corseted by types would not be true to the essence of the language.\n\nUnder a gradual typing discipline, type annotations can be specified at will: interesting parts of the program can be given explicit types and their type safety checked statically. We propose an implementation of gradual typing in Matz's Ruby Interpreter, drawing inspiration from similar additions to other dynamic languages, with strictly optional type annotations consistent with Ruby's DRY and \"lazy\" philosophy and an evaluation of the practical usefulness of gradual typing.","assignee_display_names":["Tony Arcieri","bai"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4625310783897600,"title":"Oracle-Based Program Repair","subcategory":"symbolic execution","organization":{"id":5791763432210432,"name":"Java Pathfinder Team","slug":"java-pathfinder-team","website_url":"http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/","category":"languages","contact_email":"jpf.gsoc@gmail.com","mailing_list":"http://groups.google.com/group/java-pathfinder","irc_channel":"https://webchat.freenode.net/","tagline":"JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine built for sofware verification","precis":"JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine which is written in Java, and is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from model checkers to test case generators.","description":"The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2016 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Langley Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ghDvt1ahtZE9qmSRSpd4clVP_NDCjBjR3lafePp0PbNhvuep_i5XvL-N6bZvS4WjPIvHhABf-yYvnm7xlwnQTtChljJryOQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"JPF is written in Java, and it analyzes Java bytecode.

While C++ is present in many of the libraries we use, all of them use a C interface when accessed from within the Blender core code.\n\nGood GSoC projects in the past came from a very diverse range of topics, such as Fluid Simulation, Mesh tools, Light domes, Cartoon rendering, Motion tracking, Compositing nodes, UI layout improvements, NURBs editing, and so on.\n\nWe especially invite students to contribute based on their past experience or based on their current research, so that they can efficiently bring a new development direction for Blender.\n\nMore information and a template:\nhttp://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/GoogleSummerOfCode/2016/Students","topic_tags":["3d","tools","animation","games","rendering"],"technology_tags":["c","c++","python","opengl"],"proposal_tags":["tools","simulation","modeling","uv editing","file i/o","painting","motion tracking","opengl","rendering","animation"],"ideas_list":"http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/GoogleSummerOfCode/2016/Ideas","contact_method":"foundation@blender.org","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":6359963215593472,"display_name":"Peter Cassetta","program_year":2016},"abstract":"I wish to build a package manager to allow users to update installed add-ons quickly and easily.","assignee_display_names":["Sybren"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6376975031599104,"title":"Pagure","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5630777857409024,"name":"Fedora Project","slug":"fedora-project","website_url":"http://getfedora.org","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"summer-coding@lists.fedoraproject.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding.lists.fedoraproject.org/","irc_channel":"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSOC_Guide_students","tagline":"Lead the advance of Free/Open Source Software/Content as collaborative community","precis":"The Fedora Project is a partnership of Free Software community members from around the globe who build open source communities and produce a Linux distribution called Fedora.","description":"The three elements of the Fedora mission are clear:\n* The Fedora Project always strives to lead, not follow.\n* The Fedora Project consistently seeks to create, improve, and spread free/libre code and content.\n* The Fedora Project succeeds through shared action on the part of many people throughout our community. \n\n**User base (also known as target audience)**\n\nAmong our other goals, we strive to create a distribution that is not only open to contribution but also serves the needs of a wide audience of users.

The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.\n\nJulia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great thing!

CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (http://info.cern.ch), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the world’s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits.\n\nThe projects to which students can contribute span several software projects:  SixTrack, accelerator simulation; the Geant4/Geant-V detector simulation toolkit\nthe ROOT software framework for storing and analyzing the data of the LHC experiments including machine learning software; \nCERNVM, a baseline Virtual Software Appliance for the participants of CERN LHC experiments.\n different computer platforms.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tce30thSPvwrLNLq1Qtpi6QA8Vm9jfoM3wrC_aDAmXMHFRZwlF9Y3vDc1v4BYbI7HWpOJBnPesmZn427Tp-me-EHAL50eix9","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"What to do:\n1.

The PXF standard will allow phenotypic data to be captured at the point of publication, to be transmitted in the context of diagnostic testing, to be used for exchange of data in clinical studies, and as a backbone for patient-contributed data registries and social media. Increasing the volume of computable phenotype data across a diversity of systems will support large-scale computational disease analysis using cross species genotype and phenotype data.\n\nThe initial version of the PXF standard is being implemented in the context of journals, but an editing tool to read and write PXF documents is needed to facilitate this exchange. This project can include one or more of the following tasks, depending on the status of the project at the start of the program and an agreement between the student and the mentor:\n\nAdd import and export of PXF files to the Monarch WebPhenote application.\nCreate a lightweight web application that can be integrated into other research portals and platforms to ease the creation of PXF files and enable their distribution.\nImplement tools to convert variant descriptions in other formats to PXF format. This includes the parsing of plain text, HTML and more structured formats. The PXF output from this will then be reviewable and editable by a users prior to committing the PXF.\n\nCandidates should have a good understanding of software tools such as Unix (MacOSX or Linux); Git; one or more high-level programming languages (NodeJS, Python, Go, Ruby); and a basic understanding of network usage (HTTP, SSH).

Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nBeside this we also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award or the Austrian National Innovation Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org - Beyond one Hour of Code) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years.

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the \"UIUC\" BSD-Style license.\n\nAmong the sub-projects of LLVM are:\n\n * The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). \n\n * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. \n\n * The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n\n * And many others!\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/yJ4ROVHqt70g4iaMnVIcqq5sgOD3jWkcy1D6kEQllwOPofrIgi8QWvHzWRb8p2HE40PlAgEmBnk0vteEmh8rBbelutjZVW1p","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://blog.llvm.org/","application_instructions":"Students are required to submit their proposals to the corresponding mailing lists (e.g. llvmdev@ for LLVM-related projects, clangdev@ for clang-related, etc) and discuss / refine them before submission to GSoC system.

SciRuby consists of a [fairly large number of gems](https://goo.gl/Ixha2p), including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, daru, and NMatrix.\n\nNMatrix [has been awarded grants](https://goo.gl/zSycrJ) by the [Ruby Association](https://goo.gl/C2Cd3T) in 2012 and 2015, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. [Statsample](https://goo.gl/GTm7qh) and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while [daru](https://goo.gl/DLioLK), [nyaplot](https://goo.gl/pFyO7v) and [gnuplotrb](https://goo.gl/2ttLvk) take care of data analysis and visualization. Nyaplot was also awarded the [Ruby Association Grant in 2014](https://goo.gl/usseDY).\n\nA major portion of our gems have been written by GSoC students — including Nyaplot, daru, plotrb, PubliSci, Ruby-Band, statsample-timeseries, and statsample-glm. Others, like minimization, integration and nmatrix, have been overhauled over the course of Summer of Code projects.\n\nWorking on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz.

You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.\n\nDrupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/1kbLUdbO2E-EQ5qEPK09Ke42h4cfDD4IVp836tsqsvBxP0cI0yvFlG8QUlpgrVAaYnOEN_aI53UYAP1tQtwhGsrggZ2CentO","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/113325464728592995596","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/drupal","blog_url":"https://www.drupal.org/planet","application_instructions":"Welcome, GSoC students!

There are usually two ways, precopy and postcopy. Postcopy migration is used for virtual machines which have a high memory dirtying rate, (higher than the bandwidth of the network that will be used to perform migration). The disadvantage of postcopy migration is, if there is a network failure then we are left with an inconsistent vm at both the source and the destination side.\nThe aim of this project is to recover from the network failure, and complete the migration process. The project will include completing the process of sending the leftover memory pages.\nProject would start by making sure that the threads do not fail at both the source and destination end. This would be followed by re-establishing the network connection between the source and the destination. After this is done, the migration process is restarted. The vCPUs on the destination side were suspended due to page faults, so these pages are transferred first. Followed by the rest of the leftover pages on the source side.","assignee_display_names":["Dave Gilbert"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5543039787335680,"title":"postCP Package Improvement","subcategory":"machine learning","organization":{"id":6227114235789312,"name":"R project for statistical computing","slug":"r-project-for-statistical-computing","website_url":"https://www.r-project.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","precis":"R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible","description":"R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made.

The reduced optimization problem is now solved by the solver. This has the two-fold benefit of speeding up the optimization process, and higher accuracy in solutions. Since smaller problems are fed to the solver (eg. SCS), the bottleneck call to the solver has now become significantly faster. \n\nMany commercial solver include pre-solve (like CPLEX) but almost no open source solver has an efficient and exhaustive implementation of pre-solve for LP.\nTo the best of our knowledge no first order solver has pre-solve of any kind for SDP problems. Thus adding a pre-solve to Julia-opt greatly increases the competition of open-source solvers. \n\nIdeally, we would want to remove the types of redundancy which lead to reduction in total solution time. But this isn't always possible. There is also a trade-off between time spent in the pre-solve procedure and the amount of redundancy detected by our procedure.

It supports the easy implementation of methods like Finite Elements, Discontinuous Galerkin, Finite Volumes, and Finite Differences.  \nThe underlying idea of DUNE is to create slim interfaces allowing an efficient use of legacy and/or new libraries. Modern C++ programming techniques enable different implementations of the same concept, i.e. grids or solvers,  using a common interface at a low overhead. Thus DUNE ensures efficiency in scientific computations and supports high-performance computing applications.\n\n# People\n\nDUNE developers are professors, graduate students, post-docs, or people working in industry (e.g. as freelancers or consultants), currently located in Germany, UK, and Norway. With DUNE being a scientific software, they all share a scientific education and background. But their background differs (Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics) as well as their application area (flow through porous media, linear elasticity, computational fluid dynamics, electro-magnetism, …).\n\n# History\n\nDUNE started with an inaugurating meeting in February 2002. People from different German research groups of Universities in Bonn, Freiburg, and Heidelberg shared a common interest: developing an clean, slim, and modern open source framework for the parallel solution of PDEs which would allow reusing existent legacy software via a common interface based on generic programming techniques.\n\n# DUNE's main principles\n\n* Separation of data structures and algorithms by abstract interfaces. This provides more functionality with less code and ensures maintainability and extendability of the framework.\n* Static polymorphism allows the compiler to do more optimizations, in particular function inlining, which in turn allows the interface to have very small functions without a severe performance penalty.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/VP1H_FKTvQkXk4LJrndXoR0k3ltKDSslhxwWpLCnyWTE6QP__yAG5sq2e2H1X562NpAAPCqUWAmEG2YUZzsd64lp2kNlibQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"# Proposals\n\nPlease send your proposals to the [dune-devel Mailinglist](http://lists.dune-project.org/mailman/listinfo/dune-devel) and use the tags \"[GSoC2016][Proposal]\" in the subject of the email.

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\n\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as [GPSTk](http://www.gpstk.org) or [RTKLIB](http://www.rtklib.com/)).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/lx6NdVNW_3E5Z1Sr6Q5ZxLAlWDdCWPE73yL5n61sZZl3T9fnpfAFgIDSZvy3PM9VM1jQz8qimQM4MCEYkZ9U92se_PZu628","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+GnsssdrOrgPage","twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"If you are an eligible and interested student, read through the list of projects in our [Ideas Page](http://gnss-sdr.org/documentation/google-summer-code-2016-ideas-list) and note the projects you are interested in.
