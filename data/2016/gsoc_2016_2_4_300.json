These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). \n\n * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. \n\n * The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n\n * And many others!\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.

While young among programming languages, at just over four years since its public release, it's also rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.\n\nJulia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great thing!

Cytoscape is open-source software that is popular (6350 citations as of March 22nd 2016) for the visualization of networks. As scientists work with increasing amounts of data and the expectation of reproducible computational analyses increases, many users of network visualization programs are turning to scripted analyses instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI). \nCytoscape has an application programming interface (API) that uses the Representational State Transfer (REST) to send information between Cytoscape and different programs. The package RCy3  allows users to connect R to Cytoscape allowing them to script their visualizations. There are two ways the package would be enhanced: 1) by enabling the use of Cytoscape plugins programmatically through their API, and  2) by creating robust walkthroughs of the code necessary to use RCy3 and other packages for reproducible network visualizations. The walkthroughs would include approaches relevant to many Cytoscape users and incorporate the programmatic use of plugins with developed function.","assignee_display_names":["Augustin"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4982175946506240,"title":"Enhance visitor experience of OSEM","subcategory":"osem","organization":{"id":4794149198888960,"name":"openSUSE","slug":"opensuse","website_url":"https://www.opensuse.org/","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"opensuse-project@opensuse.org","mailing_list":"https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Communication_channels","irc_channel":"https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Communication_channels","tagline":"openSUSE Linux - The makers' choice for sysadmins, developers and desktop users","precis":"openSUSE is a Free Software project to promote the use of Linux everywhere.

Leap provides a great balance between up to date and stable, hardened Free Software for your computer. Pick your desktop, configure your system and enjoy the platform of choice for Linux users, administrators and software vendors!\n\n# Tumbleweed Rolling Distribution\nIf you always want to have the newest Free Software you want the openSUSE **Tumbleweed** rolling distribution! It appeals to power users and software developers that require the latest software stacks and development environments on a stable, close to bleeding edge Linux platform. If you're living on the Free Software edge, Tumbleweed is the best choice for you!\n\n# Tools\nTo be able to produce two world class distributions, openSUSE develops a lot of system level tools like [YaST](http://yast.github.io/) our installation and configuration tool,  [Portus](https://suse.github.io/Portus/) our user interface for the next gen docker registry or [Machinery](http://machinery-project.org/) an application for configuration discovery, system validation and service migration. And because we believe that communication is the most important factor in Free Software we also develop a self-hosted open source solution for videoconferencing ([Jangouts](https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts)) and an event management app tailored for free software conferences ([Open Source Event Manager](https://osem.io)).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/OlVpIatB43YFKkbnt0ynTmgF5MKspT1E9q0JOrSph1xDdaFyJ7Azc_9UK6Y_20Jeft3V7wqtH3Wyiio97EOCz2Hd_PYbUIs","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+openSUSE/posts","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openSUSE","blog_url":"https://news.opensuse.org/","application_instructions":"# Abstract\nYour software project should solve a clearly defined problem.

You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do. \n\n# Implementation\nThis section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n# Timeline\nInclude a weekly timeline for your project. What do you expect to have ready for mid-term and final evaluation? A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is much better than a timeline that promises to move mountains. \n\n# About You\nPlease explain why you feel you are a suitable candidate to complete this project.

Also it would be good to have a schedule proposal page so that administrators can iterate before deciding which version of a schedule to  publish (openSUSE/osem#18). Allowing an individual user to build their own schedule for the conference is another feature that would improve user experience (openSUSE/osem#587). \n\nGetting feedback from different types of users (organizers, speakers, visitors) who have participated in the conference is a desirable feature for this project (openSUSE/osem#549).\n\nThe splash page can also be improved.

It will do so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500).\n\nDue to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version–controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre–trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easy–to–use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/PHSbWWY5uOfqqttU9hYhvF76EfjoLo95Qin9irXjNqns_YGWiNnnh0ZobC-y60lkVIwbGV0S0lsdi2y0XUM_XKEwiuwNN8FX","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/kyle_p_johnson","blog_url":"http://cltk.org/blog","application_instructions":"See our [Project ideas page](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/Project-ideas) for a list of tasks that are suited to three months' work for a beginning–to–intermediate programmer. What follows is a high–level overview of these projects and a few tips in applying. Most work is done in the Python and JavaScript languages, of which a beginner's or intermediate knowledge is expected. Strong experience in another OOP, however, should be adequate too.\n\nIf you know a Classical language that is not yet supported well by the CLTK (e.g., Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese), you may follow the pattern set by the current Greek and Latin libraries. See [the docs](http://docs.cltk.org/en/latest) for an idea of what can currently be done.\n\nFor those not familiar with an ancient language, there are a number of important and challenging projects. The most ambitious of these is development of [a text–serving backend API](https://github.com/cltk/cltk_api) (written in Python with Flask) and [a JavaScript frontend](https://github.com/cltk/cltk_frontend) (in Meteor and React), both of which together will allow for a seamless reading and research experience.\n\nBecause our mission is so ambitious, we encourage applicants to reach out for additional technical information and feedback on project proposals.

Slave servers then connect to the master server and read the binlog files and apply the transactions locally. During replication in MariaDB, a series of events can be grouped into one single transaction with the use of Global Transaction IDs which keep track of the event sequence: the server, the last transaction applied and the next transaction to follow. MariaDB GTIDs is a 3 segment number separated by colons (:). MariaDB binlog files are in binary and cannot be read by humans, hence the mysqlbinlog Utility converts them to SQL queries so humans can clearly read the transactions or execute the scripts on other databases. In this project, we will update the mysqlbinlog utility to understand MariaDB's GTIDs accordingly.","assignee_display_names":["byte","plinux"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6539988648853504,"title":"Enhancing Open Event Server","subcategory":"open event","organization":{"id":6245880424300544,"name":"FOSSASIA","slug":"fossasia","website_url":"http://fossasia.org","category":"Other","contact_email":"contact@fossasia.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fossasia","irc_channel":"http://fossasia-slack.herokuapp.com/","tagline":"Open Technologies for Social Change","precis":"The aim of FOSSASIA is to develop open technologies for social change in Asia and around the world.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

I propose to develop a set of specifications for an environment model generator of the LDV Tools system developed in terms of the Linux Driver Verification program.

The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

The periodic scans have to be aware of new relays, rescans of existing relays and to make the periodic scans random in order as well as frequency, while also optimizing on the resource consumption.\n * **Emulating multiple user interaction:** Intelligently using the Tor Browser webdriver through the Selenium testing framework to allow for customized user interactions. This will help better disguise scanner activity as regular user traffic.\n * **Conglomeration of scanner data from multiple users:** For volunteer run scans, making an automated mean to send logs over to a central server for analysis.

There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ghDvt1ahtZE9qmSRSpd4clVP_NDCjBjR3lafePp0PbNhvuep_i5XvL-N6bZvS4WjPIvHhABf-yYvnm7xlwnQTtChljJryOQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"JPF is written in Java, and it analyzes Java bytecode.

As it is, when you write code on their website and press submit, the code is sent to their server, compiled and the result is sent back. The problem with this, is that it doesn't show the entire capabilities of the language. For instance if you write a program that prints a message every second for 10 seconds, it will return that message printed ten times in an instant. What I want to do by using Emscripten is to have a real time tutorial, so that after the server sends back the result, it will actually print the message every one second, for ten seconds. I will also want to create a second tutorial that implements SDL as well. SDL is a language that can create shapes and interacts with keyboard inputs and the mouse. There already is compatibility between Ceu and SDL and there is also compatibility between SDL and Emscripten. The challenge is to create a synergy with all three languages. I believe this to be feasible, because you can transform a Ceu program into a C program that can then be compiled with Emscripten.","assignee_display_names":["Francisco"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4510646968254464,"title":"Extending the text module with deep Word-spotting CNN","subcategory":"deep learning","organization":{"id":6303577404342272,"name":"OpenCV","slug":"opencv","website_url":"https://github.com/itseez/opencv/wiki","category":"graphics","contact_email":"opencv-gsoc-2016@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2016","irc_channel":"http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2016","tagline":"Open Source Computer Vision and Machine Learning Library","precis":"OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library includes state of the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms and apps.

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nBeside this we also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award or the Austrian National Innovation Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org - Beyond one Hour of Code) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years.

Often, when selecting files using Ctrl+A or the selection tool, we find that we need to select only a subset of the required files we have selected. This leads to the unwieldy operation of removing files from our selection. Of course, the common workaround is to create a new folder and to put all the items in this folder prior to copying, but this is a very inefficient and very slow process if large files need to be copied. Moreover Ctrl+Click requires fine motor skills to not lose the entire selection of files.\n\nThis is an original project with a novel solution to this problem. My solution is to add a virtual folder in Dolphin where the links to files and folders can be temporarily saved for a session. The files and folders are \"staged\" on this virtual folder. Files can be added to this by using a right-click context menu option, using the mouse scroll click, or by drag and drop.  Hence, complex file operations such as moving files across many devices can be made easy by staging the operation before performing it.","assignee_display_names":["Pinak","Boudhayan Gupta"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5379467883053056,"title":"Finding and analysing copy-pasted code with clang","subcategory":"static-analysis","organization":{"id":5450930363301888,"name":"The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure","slug":"the-llvm-compiler-infrastructure","website_url":"http://www.llvm.org","category":"languages","contact_email":"llvm-dev@lists.llvm.org","mailing_list":"http://llvm.org/docs/#mailing-lists","irc_channel":"http://llvm.org/docs/#irc","tagline":"The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure","precis":"The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.","description":"The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the \"UIUC\" BSD-Style license.\n\nAmong the sub-projects of LLVM are:\n\n * The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). \n\n * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. \n\n * The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n\n * And many others!\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/yJ4ROVHqt70g4iaMnVIcqq5sgOD3jWkcy1D6kEQllwOPofrIgi8QWvHzWRb8p2HE40PlAgEmBnk0vteEmh8rBbelutjZVW1p","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://blog.llvm.org/","application_instructions":"Students are required to submit their proposals to the corresponding mailing lists (e.g. llvmdev@ for LLVM-related projects, clangdev@ for clang-related, etc) and discuss / refine them before submission to GSoC system.

This is done by symbolically executing the code block via SPF over JPF in order to generate path constraints for each possible path that a program may take. The path constraints are then put into canonical form and analyzed. Level of refinement of the path constraints dictate the level at which we model programs i.e. If we do not refine the path constraints at all, the program is modeled on a syntactical level. If we stop refinement early, the program is modeled on a semantic level but syntactical structure of the program is still considered. If we  completely refine the path constraints and put them into canonical form, the program is modeled on a semantic level with no consideration towards the syntactical structure of the program. This gives us options on applications of fingerprinting for programs. Further research in this field could result in semantic patterns not just being observed but rather analyzed. Applications of this analysis include the possible creation of a semantic auto-complete for programmers.","assignee_display_names":["Willem Visser"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5092844817612800,"title":"Finish Firebird driver integration","subcategory":"c++","organization":{"id":4911387578990592,"name":"LibreOffice","slug":"libreoffice","website_url":"https://libreoffice.org","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"thb@documentfoundation.org","mailing_list":"https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Mailing_List","irc_channel":"https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Website/IRC","tagline":"LibreOffice is a powerful cross-platform office suite.","precis":"LibreOffice is a thriving project, delivering a complete office suite on desktop and mobile.

It is used to address extremal problems on structures such as graphs, 3-regular hypergraphs, digraphs, coloured graphs, permutations, etc.). The method, in its simplest form, can be fully automated: user enters the problem statement and receives a certificate that proves the bound. For example, asking for maximum edge density in a triangle-free graph would give a response of 1/2, supported by a certificate. The method makes use of inequalities on graphs, how small graphs overlap in large graphs, and constructs an optimisation problem. Standard solvers such as CSDP, etc. can then solve the semi-definite programming task. [This is where a sub-project of writing Cython bindings for CSDP in Sage would be implemented before moving on.] Based on lower-bound constructions, we can then transform numerical values to exact ones (sometimes). \n\nThe method has been implemented in Flagmatic 2.0 by Emil Vaughan in 2013. It relies on Sage. Flagmatic can be extended in functionality and incorporated into Sage as an optional package. This would make it more useful for both researchers and students.","assignee_display_names":["Dima Pasechnik"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6620175218507776,"title":"Flexible Fast Parser Combinators","subcategory":"parsers","organization":{"id":4954864794730496,"name":"Scala","slug":"scala","website_url":"http://www.scala-lang.org","category":"languages","contact_email":"denys.shabalin@epfl.ch","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/scala-language","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"The programming language where object-oriented meets functional.","precis":"Scala is a hybrid object-oriented and functional programming language that runs on the JVM and JavaScript.","description":"# A Scalable language\nScala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: “We’ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. It’s reinvigorated the team.”","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/E8D7vgEWmTZy4LsFcyIdb4ZxwrOcQH3mkrbKC4E0TiKrvSlYEs3oU6hJCxTUMqOkSIhI720ty0K03FS4FsU8MSxjWqnQCN4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/scala_lang","blog_url":"http://www.scala-lang.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Your proposal should contain at least the following information, but\nfeel free to include anything that you think is relevant:\n\n*   Please include your name and contact details\n*   Title of your proposal\n*   Abstract of your proposal\n*   Detailed description of your idea including explanation on why is it innovative, what contribution do you expect to make to the Scala community and why do you think your project is needed, a rough plan of your  development and possible architecture sketches.\n*   Description of previous work, existing solutions \n*   Write us about yourself and convince us that you are the right  person for the job (linking to your resume/CV is good but not sufficient)\n    *   Mention the details of your academic studies, any previous work, internships\n    *   Any relevant skills that will help you to achieve the goal?\n    *   Any previous open-source projects you have contributed to?\n    *   Do you plan to have any other commitments during SoC that may affect you work?

The methods for solving these different tasks can be very different and highly targeted for that special object type. Because of this reason we have implementation of crude detection/recognition algorithms scattered over different places without any common standard. Even with the availability of dedicated computer vision libraries like OpenCV/PCL, implementation of a simple object detection application based on the existing techniques is not a trivial task as it should be. \n\nThus, the purpose of this library is to contribute in this field and make available the existing solution in this direction in a common, very structured, and a very user-friendly APIs.

It is also very important to provide the library with the ability to be built cross platform among standard operating systems. After this objective, it would be good to integrate some existing state of the art algorithms like GPUSurf for 2D object detection and Viola-Jones GPU Face Detector. Based on the necessary time for this phase, it would also be nice to integrate a recent detection algorithm into the library. The last step consists in writing a clear documentation along with some more examples for the new library.","assignee_display_names":["Kripasindhu"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5219656549793792,"title":"Front end rethink","subcategory":"refactoring","organization":{"id":5106257895620608,"name":"Green Navigation","slug":"green-naviagtion","website_url":"https://www.isp.uni-luebeck.de/research/projects/green-navigation","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"greennav@isp.uni-luebeck.de","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/greennav","irc_channel":"","tagline":"Routing Service for finding the shortest, fastest and most energy efficient way.","precis":"GreenNav is an open source organization that aims to combine many different aspects of electromobility routing","description":"GreenNav is an open source organisation that emerged from an university project and combines many different aspects of electromobility routing.

HTTP/2 provides a lot of features that are also implemented in Hot Rod protocol. For example, using the HTTP/2 will be more preferable than Hot Rod because the size of the requests and responses will be smaller.\n\nExpected results of this project are:\n1. Modify current REST Server endpoint for Infinispan to handle HTTP/2 protocol. Modification will be based on implementing features from Hot Rod protocol to HTTP/2.\n2.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made.

Advanced users can write C/C++ code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager. \n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ekwi0uQlxrrJ8aaXXewA3B_vRUbpPQj-MjjS1nkPjE82FdAG5FbeY3FX4L5U2rno5qxAMABcQVKXneMpSyjdjRAupl0J6SuB","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ensembl","blog_url":"http://www.ensembl.info/","application_instructions":"Please structure your proposals as described in the instructions from the Google Summer of Code portal:\n- Name and contact information\n- Title\n- Synopsis\n- Benefits to the community\n- Deliverables\n- Related work\n- Biographical information\n\nYou’ll notice that the projects we suggest do not follow this format.

In the past this sequence information consisted of a single reference sequence, which can be relatively easily visualised in a linear way. Today we often know multiple variants of a particular DNA sequence. The differences between the individual sequences are called polymorphisms and can range in size from variations of a single base pair (single nucleotide polymorphism = SNP) to variations involving long stretches of DNA. \n\nThere are a number of approaches (and file formats) for formally encoding variants of genomic sequences and their relationships in the form of graphs. Unfortunately it is often difficult to visualise these graphs in a way which conveys the complex information yet is intuitively easy to understand. The goal of this project is to help in the visualisation of genomic sequences and their variations by providing a JavaScript module which generates visual representations of genomic sequence graphs. This module aims to display the information about all sequence variants in a single visualisation as elegantly as possible.","assignee_display_names":["Daniel Zerbino"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5134215049904128,"title":"Gentoo Keys Improvements and new MetaManifest system","subcategory":"improvement","organization":{"id":6589886970724352,"name":"Gentoo Foundation","slug":"gentoo-foundation","website_url":"http://www.gentoo.org","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"gentoo-soc@lists.gentoo.org","mailing_list":"https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2016/Application_Guidelines","irc_channel":"https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2016/Application_Guidelines","tagline":"A flexible, source-based Linux distribution.","precis":"Flexible, source-based Linux distribution which becomes just about any system you need—and much more.","description":"Every user has work they need to do. The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

Also it attempts to work on better algorithms for emotion/gaze direction etc. detection.

Very simple animations can often efficiently communicate abstract ideas, especially in technical fields. However, with many of the currently available tools, designing even simple animations can involve heavy design loads which technically inclined creators are not always eager to carry. This project aims to solve this issue by providing simple tools to create expressive GIFs by writing small scripts. The scripting language provides means to describe technical animations by typing code, instead of relying on click-and-drag interfaces of most design programs, which is in fact more practical when the animation we intend to create involves objects describable mathematically or programmatically.\nThe core tool will thus be a small program which takes a script written by the user and outputs the GIF animation described in the script.","assignee_display_names":["Bart Massey"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6649256878276608,"title":"Git Backend","subcategory":"python","organization":{"id":5043630024687616,"name":"Sugar Labs","slug":"sugar-labs","website_url":"http://sugarlabs.org","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"iaep@lists.sugarlabs.org","mailing_list":"http://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/sugar-devel","irc_channel":"http://chat.sugarlabs.org:9090/","tagline":"Learning software for children","precis":"Sugar is a learning platform and collection of activities for elementary education.","description":"Sugar is a learning platform that reinvents how computers are used for education.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager. \n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day.

Currently the eHive workflows are manually coded and this requires expertise in computer science. It also takes up a lot of time. Due to such shortcomings handling workflows becomes very cumbersome.\n\nThis project aims to remove these drawbacks of the existing system by creating a graphical editor for eHive workflows using Google's Blockly library which would enable us to visualize the XML code in terms of Blockly blocks and provide output for them in XML format using Blockly's existing \"Export to XML\" option. The backbone of this graphical editor would be some rules written to handle the Relax NG XML schema specification and to create Blockly blocks automatically in accordance with the same.\n\nFor example, the XML to Blockly converter would apply pre-defined rules to the Relax NG specification entered by the user, and generate code to represent the specification using Blockly blocks.\n\nThe proposed editor would have capabilities of handling not just workflows for eHive, but any specifications written using the Relax NG schema.","assignee_display_names":["Matthieu Muffato"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6063379449905152,"title":"GRASS GSoC2016 Proposal Bo Yang","subcategory":"grass gis","organization":{"id":6273632556810240,"name":"OSGeo - The Open Source Geospatial Foundation","slug":"osgeo-the-open-source-geospatial-foundation","website_url":"http://osgeo.org","category":"Other","contact_email":"info@osgeo.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/soc","irc_channel":"http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/IRC","tagline":"The Open Source Geospatial Foundation","precis":"OSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community.","description":"OSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community in general and several code projects in particular:\n\nWeb Mapping: deegree, geomajas, GeoMOOSE, GeoServer, Mapbender, MapBuilder, MapFish, MapGuide Open Source, MapServer, OpenLayers\n\nDesktop Applications: GRASS GIS, QGIS, gvSIG, Marble\n\nGeospatial Libraries: FDO, GDAL/OGR, GEOS, GeoTools, OSSIM, PostGIS\n\nMetadata Catalogues: GeoNetwork, pycsw\n\nOther incubating projects include: istSOS, PyWPS, Team Engine, ZOO-Project, Opticks, MetaCRS, Orfeo ToolBox (OTB), rasdaman, GeoNode\n\nOther (non-code) Projects: Public Geospatial Data, Education and Curriculum, Live Handout DVD\n\nWe host regional and international FOSS4G conferences with typical attendance of 500-1000+ geospatial developers, industry and government types, and researchers.

It would be more useful and comprehensive to add at least one or two top-down methods to the i.segment module because the current region growing approach only allows bottom-up hierarchical segmentation. New segment methods, such as mean-shift and watershed, would allow top-down hierarchical segmentation, which could be used in more types of satellite image processing.

Syslog-ng is rightly known as the \"Swiss Army Knife of logging\" because of its rich filtering capabilities, flexible configuration options.\n[WebSocket protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)   is a protocol enabling two-way communication between  a client and server over a single TCP connection.  \nThis project will add WebSocket as a destination for syslog-ng.  The new destination can send log messages to an WebSocket Server directly. In addition, this project will enable the new destination to act as a WebSocket server,  so the WebSocket client (such as a javascript client in a browser) could subscribe directly to it to get log messages.  These will make sending log message privately or  publicly much easier.\nThis project will add WebSocket as a source for sysnlog-ng.

Linux XIA is developed at Boston University (BU) under the supervision of Computer Science Professor John W. Byers, one of the principal investigators of the XIA project. Michel Machado developed Linux XIA as part of his Ph.D. thesis, and continues the development as a visiting researcher at BU. The team at BU also includes the Ph.D. students Cody Doucette and Qiaobin Fu.\n\nThe suggested projects that we have in our ideas list this year cater to students proficient in C programming, and comfortable with advanced data structures.

Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nBeside this we also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award or the Austrian National Innovation Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org - Beyond one Hour of Code) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code.

Every year, we have to reject a handful of proposals because we cannot locate a suitable mentor.\n * Read the mailing lists. By reading the mailing lists, you'll learn a lot about how the FreeBSD project operates and what kind of people participate.\n * Talk about your idea in public. The freebsd-hackers@freebsd.org mailing list, in particular, is an open forum where many people share ideas about how to improve FreeBSD. By discussing your idea there, you can get feedback that will help improve your proposal and demonstrate that there is interest in your idea.\n * Contribute. Send us a patch! Even if it's not accepted, your patch will show us that you use FreeBSD, have the coding skills we need from GSoC students, and have looked at the source code.

Moreover, Digital pathology and microscopy image analysis are widely used for comprehensive studies of cell morphology or tissue structure. However, manual examination and decision-making using tissue slides that may potentially contain millions of cells can be time-consuming and subjective. Computer-aided methods, which can significantly improve the objectivity and reproducibility, have attracted a great deal of interest in recent literature. Recently a cell segmentation method for whole slide images is developed which demonstrated its efficacy on limited image regions. However, the computational complexity and memory requirement for this method is high. To implement and deploy the proposed analysis in a cluster computing environment, a high throughput system equivalent needs to be implemented using C++. Additionally, we will use functionalities from different open source libraries such as OpenSlide, OpenCV, CImg, Magick++ etc.","assignee_display_names":["junkong999@gmail.com","Fusheng Wang"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6687117283426304,"title":"High-performance P4 software switch using netmap","subcategory":"other","organization":{"id":4892834293350400,"name":"FreeBSD","slug":"freebsd","website_url":"https://www.FreeBSD.org/","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"soc-admins@FreeBSD.org","mailing_list":"http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-hackers","irc_channel":"https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCodeIRC","tagline":"FreeBSD: The Foundation of the Internet","precis":"An advanced operating system for modern server, desktop and embedded platforms which can be found powering everything from the smallest home routers to the world's busiest servers.","description":"FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms.

Many of those ideas are applicable to solving some of today's problems we face when writing parallel applications for modern multi-core machines. For this reason we center our effort around HPX (High Performance ParalleX), a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale, which implements many of those ideas.\n\nThe goal for HPX is to create a high quality, freely available, open source implementation of the ParalleX model for conventional systems, such as classic Linux based Beowulf clusters or multi-socket highly parallel SMP nodes. At the same time, we want to have a very modular and well designed runtime system architecture which would allow us to port our implementation onto new computer system architectures. We use real world applications to drive the development of the runtime system, coining out required functionalities and converging onto an stable API which will provide a smooth migration path for developers. The API exposed by HPX is modeled after the interfaces defined by the C++ ISO standard and adheres to the programming guidelines used by the Boost collection of C++ libraries.\n\nHPX has an active development team that has increased non-stop since 2007 (ref: http://www.openhub.net/p/stellar-hpx) thanks to a modular design that enables features to be added easily.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Boost Software License (BSL-1.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/CueHK3ok7CemdBgkfP3c4a_mlF9DMRjH5GOiEEc41fZ5nJMmFEJorIotMdqux1mKYSppJqSKzQjoVdrYKH9IWzWrd3sSjg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://stellar-group.org/blog/","application_instructions":"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-Submission-Template","topic_tags":["runtime systems","parallel computing","high performance computing","hpx","gpu"],"technology_tags":["parallel processing","high performance computing","c++","cuda","opencl"],"proposal_tags":["new feature","optimization","refactoring","bug fixing"],"ideas_list":"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2016-Project-Ideas","contact_method":"hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":6166747904212992,"display_name":"Parsa Amini","program_year":2016},"abstract":"Debugging distributed HPX applications with regular tools is a tedious task and not always helpful.

While young among programming languages, at just over four years since its public release, it's also rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.\n\nJulia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great thing! Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great opportunity to not only build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different!

While young among programming languages, at just over four years since its public release, it's also rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.\n\nJulia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great thing! Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great opportunity to not only build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different!

For this reason we center our effort around HPX (High Performance ParalleX), a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale, which implements many of those ideas.\n\nThe goal for HPX is to create a high quality, freely available, open source implementation of the ParalleX model for conventional systems, such as classic Linux based Beowulf clusters or multi-socket highly parallel SMP nodes.

The project provides libraries to make it quick/easy to write portable software for devices of all sizes.","description":"Soletta Project is a framework for making IoT devices. With Soletta Project's libraries developers can easily write software for devices that control actuators/sensors (I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC, PWM and others) and communicate using standard technologies (OIC, CoAP, HTTP, MQTT, LWM2M, Mavlink and others). It enables adding smartness even on the smallest edge devices.\n\nPortable and scalable, it abstracts details of hardware and OS, enabling developers to reuse their code and knowledge on different targets. The framework has ports done to the following targets:\n * Linux\n * Zephyr OS\n * RIOT OS\n * (Partially) Contiki OS\n\nBy writing a Soletta application, it's a matter of parametrising specific OS values, like GPIO pin numbers and such (Soletta already eases that task) and, with a makefile that builds with the respective toolchains/SDKs, the same application would be functional for all supported targets.\n\nOne of the ways Soletta exposes of writing applications is by flow-based programming (FBP), which allows the programmer to express business logic as a directional graph of nodes connected to type-specific ports.\n\nThe connected node ports will exchange information packets (IP) that will be used to run the flow. The packet can be either empty, used just to trigger an action, or carry a value such as booleans, integers, floats and even complex data types such as blobs. Ports can decide if the packets they produce will be queued or replaced if they were not consumed by target ports when a new packet is to be produced.\n\nFor those used to traditional object oriented programming (OOP) it's like using the observer pattern on source nodes, calling the associated data getter which is then forwarded to target nodes by calling their setter. However this is done by the core in an efficient and safe way as no memory leaks, type mismatch or invalid memory access can happen.\n\nBesides that, Soletta exposes all its functionality on a C API, so that FBP is not mandatory.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ifDN2drTzCdswKo73cM1qwdd4SD88p9I4Jdsi3FM678xcpazUmDyEz50QtL3oiEWcc5TNsq51A1pKXh3BrOqOedR1nLrn5Ph","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Students wishing to apply to help on Soletta must at have at least medium knowledge of the C language, that is used everywhere in the framework.

The project provides libraries to make it quick/easy to write portable software for devices of all sizes.","description":"Soletta Project is a framework for making IoT devices. With Soletta Project's libraries developers can easily write software for devices that control actuators/sensors (I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC, PWM and others) and communicate using standard technologies (OIC, CoAP, HTTP, MQTT, LWM2M, Mavlink and others). It enables adding smartness even on the smallest edge devices.\n\nPortable and scalable, it abstracts details of hardware and OS, enabling developers to reuse their code and knowledge on different targets. The framework has ports done to the following targets:\n * Linux\n * Zephyr OS\n * RIOT OS\n * (Partially) Contiki OS\n\nBy writing a Soletta application, it's a matter of parametrising specific OS values, like GPIO pin numbers and such (Soletta already eases that task) and, with a makefile that builds with the respective toolchains/SDKs, the same application would be functional for all supported targets.\n\nOne of the ways Soletta exposes of writing applications is by flow-based programming (FBP), which allows the programmer to express business logic as a directional graph of nodes connected to type-specific ports.\n\nThe connected node ports will exchange information packets (IP) that will be used to run the flow. The packet can be either empty, used just to trigger an action, or carry a value such as booleans, integers, floats and even complex data types such as blobs. Ports can decide if the packets they produce will be queued or replaced if they were not consumed by target ports when a new packet is to be produced.\n\nFor those used to traditional object oriented programming (OOP) it's like using the observer pattern on source nodes, calling the associated data getter which is then forwarded to target nodes by calling their setter. However this is done by the core in an efficient and safe way as no memory leaks, type mismatch or invalid memory access can happen.\n\nBesides that, Soletta exposes all its functionality on a C API, so that FBP is not mandatory.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ifDN2drTzCdswKo73cM1qwdd4SD88p9I4Jdsi3FM678xcpazUmDyEz50QtL3oiEWcc5TNsq51A1pKXh3BrOqOedR1nLrn5Ph","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Students wishing to apply to help on Soletta must at have at least medium knowledge of the C language, that is used everywhere in the framework.

With Google too set to migrate to a DMARC `p=reject` policy in the near future, the importance of the ARC protocol has become more significant.\nBasically, setting up ARC would allow Mailman to securely register its handling of the message, thus allowing the set-up of a trust mechanism between Mailman and the involved MTAs and hence reducing the denial of service.","assignee_display_names":["Barry","yaseppochi"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5090588751822848,"title":"Implement MSYS2 based build process and  improve packaging for Mac","subcategory":"new-feature","organization":{"id":5282001347149824,"name":"ASCEND","slug":"ascend","website_url":"http://ascend4.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"http://ascend4.org/Support","irc_channel":"","tagline":"Equation-solving software for engineering system modelling","precis":"ASCEND is a free open-source software program for solving small to very large mathematical models, incorporating a specialised modeling language together with solver and GUI tools.","description":"ASCEND is a free open-source software program for solving small to very large mathematical models.

To do so, one can not “just fit a model with hundreds parameters”. In fact, there exist several problems with this “brute force” approach, and the most critical one might be that the parameter space will have many dimensions (as many as the number of parameters, precisely), which almost certainly will make optimization algorithms to diverge or to get stuck in a local minima.\n\nHence, my primary task is to work on developing an algorithm to localize, fit, and perform photometry of several overlapping objects (e.g. a dense star cluster, globular clusters, etc) simultaneously.","assignee_display_names":["hamogu","bsipocz","Erik Tollerud"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6347938166996992,"title":"Implement RFC7512 PKCS#11 URI support and system integration","subcategory":"idea from the list","organization":{"id":5256839985889280,"name":"Mozilla","slug":"mozilla","website_url":"http://www.mozilla.org/","category":"Web","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo","irc_channel":"https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC","tagline":"We're building a better Internet","precis":"The mission of the Mozilla Project is to preserve choice and innovation on the Internet.

LibreOffice embeds several applications that make it the most powerful Free & Open Source Office suite on the market: Writer, the word processor, Calc, the spreadsheet application, Impress, the presentation engine, Draw, our drawing and flowcharting application, Base, our database and database frontend, and Math for editing mathematics.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice is compatible with many document formats such as Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. But LibreOffice goes further by enabling you to use a modern open standard, the OpenDocument Format (ODF).\r\n\r\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates into better compatibility, more utility, and no lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better quality, higher reliability, increased security, and greater flexibility than proprietary alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe community behind LibreOffice is what sets this project apart. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. We invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice even better and accessible to all.\r\n\r\nThe LibreOffice project is hosted and run by the Document Foundation, a charity setup by the community, for the community.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: “We’ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. It’s reinvigorated the team.”","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/E8D7vgEWmTZy4LsFcyIdb4ZxwrOcQH3mkrbKC4E0TiKrvSlYEs3oU6hJCxTUMqOkSIhI720ty0K03FS4FsU8MSxjWqnQCN4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/scala_lang","blog_url":"http://www.scala-lang.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Your proposal should contain at least the following information, but\nfeel free to include anything that you think is relevant:\n\n*   Please include your name and contact details\n*   Title of your proposal\n*   Abstract of your proposal\n*   Detailed description of your idea including explanation on why is it innovative, what contribution do you expect to make to the Scala community and why do you think your project is needed, a rough plan of your  development and possible architecture sketches.\n*   Description of previous work, existing solutions \n*   Write us about yourself and convince us that you are the right  person for the job (linking to your resume/CV is good but not sufficient)\n    *   Mention the details of your academic studies, any previous work, internships\n    *   Any relevant skills that will help you to achieve the goal?\n    *   Any previous open-source projects you have contributed to?\n    *   Do you plan to have any other commitments during SoC that may affect you work?

CERN is one of the world’s largest and most exciting centers for fundamental physics research. Experiments at CERN have probed the fundamental nature of matter and the forces which affect it. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (http://info.cern.ch), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the world’s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits.\n\nThe projects to which students can contribute span several software projects:  SixTrack, accelerator simulation; the Geant4/Geant-V detector simulation toolkit\nthe ROOT software framework for storing and analyzing the data of the LHC experiments including machine learning software; \nCERNVM, a baseline Virtual Software Appliance for the participants of CERN LHC experiments.\n different computer platforms.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tce30thSPvwrLNLq1Qtpi6QA8Vm9jfoM3wrC_aDAmXMHFRZwlF9Y3vDc1v4BYbI7HWpOJBnPesmZn427Tp-me-EHAL50eix9","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"What to do:\n1.

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\n\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as [GPSTk](http://www.gpstk.org) or [RTKLIB](http://www.rtklib.com/)).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/lx6NdVNW_3E5Z1Sr6Q5ZxLAlWDdCWPE73yL5n61sZZl3T9fnpfAFgIDSZvy3PM9VM1jQz8qimQM4MCEYkZ9U92se_PZu628","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+GnsssdrOrgPage","twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"If you are an eligible and interested student, read through the list of projects in our [Ideas Page](http://gnss-sdr.org/documentation/google-summer-code-2016-ideas-list) and note the projects you are interested in.

This project aims to use SunPy to infer plasma properties like temperature and density by developing the routines necessary to calculate two response functions for the AIA using Python and ChiantiPy. They are wavelength response functions that calculate the amount of flux per wavelength as measured by AIA, and temperature response functions that calculate the sensitivity of light from the plasma per temperature as measured by AIA.","assignee_display_names":["SolarDrew","wtbarnes"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5899041116258304,"title":"Implementing Finite Fields and Set module in SymEngine","subcategory":"symengine","organization":{"id":6152230877003776,"name":"SymPy","slug":"sympy","website_url":"http://sympy.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"http://groups.google.com/group/sympy","irc_channel":"https://gitter.im/sympy/sympy","tagline":"Computer algebra system in Python","precis":"Computer algebra system in Python","description":"SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

And in symbolic mathematics, it is one of the basic requirement over which other algorithms can be implemented. Currently, SymEngine has the implementation of Univariate Polynomial class, which provides us the basic functionality to add, multiply and subtract two polynomials.\n\nNow, comes the problem of factoring the polynomials and then other modular arithmetics and, `gcd` and `lcm`.\n\nTherefore, we need to have a module, which can convert the polynomial into a finite field (or [Galois Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_field)), do basic operations of `add`, `mul`, `div` etc. on them and then the algorithms for factorization like:\n- [Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%E2%80%93Zassenhaus_algorithm)\n- [Berlekamp's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlekamp's_algorithm)\n\nAfter doing factorization, we will be able to find roots, which in turn will help us to solve univariate polynomial equations. Then for returning solution, `Set` are the simplest and most intuitive way. Like in real pen-paper exam, we are supposed to return solutions in form of sets. So, here also, following the way sympy has been adapting to `solveset`, we should develop a basic infrastructure, over which `solveset` can be developed.","assignee_display_names":["thilinarmtb","sumith1896","Ondřej Čertík","isuruf"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4597267029819392,"title":"Implementing HTML E-Mail support for MediaWiki","subcategory":"notifications","organization":{"id":5813448017444864,"name":"Wikimedia Foundation","slug":"wikimedia-foundation","website_url":"http://wikimediafoundation.org/","category":"Web","contact_email":"wikitech-l@lists.wikimedia.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l","irc_channel":"http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wikimedia-dev","tagline":"A global movement with a mission to bring free educational content to the world","precis":"Wikimedia is a global movement, bringing in free educational content to the world through its projects, chapters, and the support structure of the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation.","description":"**We believe that knowledge should be free for every human being.** We prioritize efforts that empower disadvantaged and underrepresented communities, and that help overcome barriers to participation.

It works sending periodical messages to his neighbors with the aim of transmitting information about topology changes. With these information each node of the network is able calculate the paths to reach any other destination. \nThese messages are periodically generated, based on the configuration parameter that regulates the sending interval. A short period will make the network react rapidly but it will also cause a large overhead due to control messages.\nPop Routing is a recent technique that takes advantage of the knowledge of the network topology to find the optimal value for the OONF’s timers. Using Pop Routing every node computes its own “betweenness centrality” and uses it to calculate the optimal trade-off between convergence and overhead. The  algorithm has been developed at the UniTN and the needed libraries to compute the BC are available as free software.\nMy goal is to build a daemon that can calculate autonomously the BC of the network, together with a plugin for OONF that will use this value to tune its timers.","assignee_display_names":["Leonardo Maccari"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4504639135285248,"title":"Implementing Service Worker Infrastructure in Servo Browser Engine","subcategory":"idea from the list","organization":{"id":5256839985889280,"name":"Mozilla","slug":"mozilla","website_url":"http://www.mozilla.org/","category":"Web","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo","irc_channel":"https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC","tagline":"We're building a better Internet","precis":"The mission of the Mozilla Project is to preserve choice and innovation on the Internet.

At the same time, we want to have a very modular and well designed runtime system architecture which would allow us to port our implementation onto new computer system architectures. We use real world applications to drive the development of the runtime system, coining out required functionalities and converging onto an stable API which will provide a smooth migration path for developers.

The goals of this project is to enhance MariaDB dynamic columns by:\n\n1- Adding support for storing  arrays in dynamic columns such that the array indices could be used as column names to access the dynamic column field values in O(1).\n\n2-It will also provide interface methods in a client library as an extension of Connector/C to capture data from dynamic columns into variables in Connector/C client applications.\n\n3- A clean means for inserting formatted data(JSON,XML,...) into dynamic columns in the Server using user defined functions derived from the library above and the UDF API.","assignee_display_names":["Oleksandr \"Sanja\" Byelkin","Georg"],"program_year":2016},{"id":5885849749159936,"title":"Import from Google Sheets","subcategory":"matched","organization":{"id":4812886060826624,"name":"CiviCRM","slug":"civicrm","website_url":"https://www.civicrm.org","category":"social_communications","contact_email":"info@civicrm.org","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#civicrm","tagline":"Contact relationship management for non-profits, NGOs and advocacy organizations","precis":"Web-based Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) software geared toward non-profit and other civic-sector organizations which is used by more than 10,600 organizations.","description":"CiviCRM is the CRM of several Google Summer of Code mentoring organizations from previous years including CERN, Creative Commons, Drupal Association, and Electronic Frontier Foundation.

RiPPs can be divided in more than 20 sub-classes and have a wide range of biological functions:  among others, they can work as antibiotics, nutritional additives or food preservatives.

Working together with the mentors, who can provide technical and scientific advice, antiSMMASH plug-ins will be created to allow researchers to identify the RiPP precursor gene, identify the cleavage sites of the core peptide and predict further modifications to its sctructure.

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the \"UIUC\" BSD-Style license.\n\nAmong the sub-projects of LLVM are:\n\n * The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\"). \n\n * Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. \n\n * The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n\n * And many others!\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/yJ4ROVHqt70g4iaMnVIcqq5sgOD3jWkcy1D6kEQllwOPofrIgi8QWvHzWRb8p2HE40PlAgEmBnk0vteEmh8rBbelutjZVW1p","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://blog.llvm.org/","application_instructions":"Students are required to submit their proposals to the corresponding mailing lists (e.g. llvmdev@ for LLVM-related projects, clangdev@ for clang-related, etc) and discuss / refine them before submission to GSoC system.

Therefore I would like to make this extension available to users who use other browsers such as Safari and Firefox. I would also love to make this extension for any other such browser.","assignee_display_names":["Ekaterina","Bruno W P"],"program_year":2016},{"id":4744653517619200,"title":"Improving collective.easyforms","subcategory":"add-on","organization":{"id":6123238505578496,"name":"Plone Foundation","slug":"plone-foundation","website_url":"https://plone.org/","category":"Web","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://community.plone.org/t/about-the-core-development-category/8","irc_channel":"https://plone.org/support/chat","tagline":"The premier python-based content management system","precis":"Plone is a free CMS built using Python and some JavaScript.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P0N4iRgvNJOYeFEHCMZ-s2kh2tL7_QDjtwMEiKab9eikjnyUXANJnun37Rp7zDFjMT8X994J8USoIVHZP3J6Zjp5t4xCIMo","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"We get a lot of excellent proposals to work on FreeBSD during Google Summer of Code. Although none of the following are required, they can help make your proposal stand out:\n\n * Find a mentor. You'll need to work closely with a FreeBSD developer who is willing to act as your GSoC mentor. If you can find a developer who is willing to commit to helping you, that is a big boost. Every year, we have to reject a handful of proposals because we cannot locate a suitable mentor.\n * Read the mailing lists. By reading the mailing lists, you'll learn a lot about how the FreeBSD project operates and what kind of people participate.\n * Talk about your idea in public. The freebsd-hackers@freebsd.org mailing list, in particular, is an open forum where many people share ideas about how to improve FreeBSD. By discussing your idea there, you can get feedback that will help improve your proposal and demonstrate that there is interest in your idea.\n * Contribute. Send us a patch! Even if it's not accepted, your patch will show us that you use FreeBSD, have the coding skills we need from GSoC students, and have looked at the source code. If you plan to work on the ports collection, port some software to get familiar with the infrastructure.\n\nFull details on how to apply and links to other useful Summer of Code resources and documentation can be found at <https://GSoC.freebsd.org/>.","topic_tags":["virtualization","embeddded","kernel","cloud","security"],"technology_tags":["c/c++","clang","llvm","shell script","make"],"proposal_tags":["kernel","ports","base system","security","capsicum","bhyve","embedded","arm","mips","other"],"ideas_list":"https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCodeIdeas","contact_method":"soc-admins@FreeBSD.org","program_year":2016},"student":{"id":6362021008244736,"display_name":"Fabian Freyer","program_year":2016},"abstract":"The primary aim of this project would be to improve libvirt support for bhyve.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C/C++ code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many thousands more packages are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, and is now fully integrated with markdown, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/coLz5PZ9_dPgJhytiV90STrLwp4kE_a9rXnFfnBzJfhMiYElXyevKIHw7n5sqAI6yy4lDE_zSRtrwqIPtFDckr1XN3uWLA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project that needs a student on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\nnote that some projects may be marked as already having a primary student\n\n2.

Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BysAfkJVFJ-LXVlA8tRsqC9L_qUmibSINyRN5PEDY-Qwqme4kjYjrwNCuGHmE1OHqGPUv0D9Dz1TLPHJYKWlFdW-h29GgZ0","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"http://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

It provides a unique user­-friendly and \"biology­-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.\n\n# Who is using cBioPortal?\nThe [public instance of cBioPortal](http://www.cbioportal.org/) is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 1,500 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal ([Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012](http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/2/5/401.abstract) & [Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550210)) have been cited more than 1,100 and 700 times, respectively, since their publication. [LabWorm](https://labworm.com/blog/top-research-tools-of-2015/) ranked the cBioPortal #4 of the top 15 research tools in 2015. There are more than 30 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes all over the globe. Notable, cBioPortal has been adopted as the analysis and visualization platform by [AACR GENIE](http://blog.aacr.org/aacr-project-genie-the-sharing-economy-comes-to-the-clinic/), an international multi-institutional data-sharing project to catalyze precision oncology.\n\n# Who are we?\nWe are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing “big data” of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from  [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/), [the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org/), [Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](http://www.theprincessmargaret.ca/), [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](http://www.chop.edu/), and [The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands](http://thehyve.nl/).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/eTDOH2UDuzDm95_yGpFS2OvWFbI67-K3u21fVcxCt_nzfMsP1utdcm6OI2_6CGpiduv4xCqfhjErTuoNzW4skLke2pcNPQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/cbioportal","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"* Develop your project proposal based on one of [the ideas](https://github.com/cBioPortal/GSoC/issues).

The present implementation (https://github.com/cbioportal/clinical-timeline) is pretty rudimentary and there is a lot that can be improved upon. There are many new features that I plan to implement so that the end users and the researchers have better tools for analyzing and visualising the data. \n\nAlong with the features, proper unit tests will be written which will help maintain the project better, ensure it doesn’t break anytime and also demonstrate that my code works.\nMany unattended bugs that the timeline has will also be fixed so that it works smoothly and as expected.\n\nThis project will provide a better toolset for clinicians to analyse the patient’s data and that in turn would help society at large.

We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BysAfkJVFJ-LXVlA8tRsqC9L_qUmibSINyRN5PEDY-Qwqme4kjYjrwNCuGHmE1OHqGPUv0D9Dz1TLPHJYKWlFdW-h29GgZ0","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"http://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

An issue that users of PEG-based parsers face is poor reporting of syntax errors on the part of PEG-based parsers.

Labels can be used to signal different kinds of errors and to specify which alternative in a labeled ordered choice should handle a given label.\n\nThe goal of this project is to rewrite the parsers of some Lua libraries, such as the module re from LPeg and lua-parser, by using LPegLabel. After this rewriting we should get parsers with better error messages.","assignee_display_names":["Sérgio Queiroz de Medeiros"],"program_year":2016},{"id":6263012348395520,"title":"Improving the state of Optim.jl","subcategory":"juliaopt","organization":{"id":5706033703944192,"name":"NumFOCUS","slug":"numfocus","website_url":"http://numfocus.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"info@numfocus.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/a/numfocus.org/forum/#!forum/gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"NumFOCUS promotes open source scientific software.","precis":"NumFOCUS is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software.","description":"The mission of NumFOCUS is to promote sustainable high-level programming languages, open code development, and reproducible scientific research.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C/C++ code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many thousands more packages are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, and is now fully integrated with markdown, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/coLz5PZ9_dPgJhytiV90STrLwp4kE_a9rXnFfnBzJfhMiYElXyevKIHw7n5sqAI6yy4lDE_zSRtrwqIPtFDckr1XN3uWLA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project that needs a student on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\nnote that some projects may be marked as already having a primary student\n\n2.

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level.  For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body.  These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance.  Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mQrW1ai7kPxsmX7Dv2LHsh_x3h3t9RWf-i33JqVtaoMF1B8SN7AgpCypD6gUrNqf6sicXo9iXRn_wBhb2PUEI2jemSQMz0g","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ChapelLanguage","blog_url":"http://chapel.cray.com/editorials.html","application_instructions":"1.

See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how **BBC** has created the *World Cup 2010* website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.\n\nOr, more recently, did you see that **IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge**?\n\n# DBpedia Spotlight\n**DBpedia Spotlight** is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that *Spotting*) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that *Disambiguation*).

All development work that is undertaken is free and open-source.\nIn previous years, GSOC students have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (>1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration platform; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data.\nMany of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences. Some of the projects proved to be so successful, that they were adopted in major national/international biomedical research initiatives.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Vn_xOoFAumQV9BZ5EFgyP4qBNoJ7z6-Fg4x84Tp1MdcaaEeqoskYxaqmj_EyrOmx3Ip4f9xAg0tfBgkYDpaxfSAt2U6gQLE","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"","application_instructions":"This year we will be using Slack as the primary medium of communication.

LibreOffice embeds several applications that make it the most powerful Free & Open Source Office suite on the market: Writer, the word processor, Calc, the spreadsheet application, Impress, the presentation engine, Draw, our drawing and flowcharting application, Base, our database and database frontend, and Math for editing mathematics.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice is compatible with many document formats such as Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. But LibreOffice goes further by enabling you to use a modern open standard, the OpenDocument Format (ODF).\r\n\r\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates into better compatibility, more utility, and no lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better quality, higher reliability, increased security, and greater flexibility than proprietary alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe community behind LibreOffice is what sets this project apart. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. We invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice even better and accessible to all.\r\n\r\nThe LibreOffice project is hosted and run by the Document Foundation, a charity setup by the community, for the community.

Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BysAfkJVFJ-LXVlA8tRsqC9L_qUmibSINyRN5PEDY-Qwqme4kjYjrwNCuGHmE1OHqGPUv0D9Dz1TLPHJYKWlFdW-h29GgZ0","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"http://honeynet.org/blog","application_instructions":"This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too.

Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.\n\nIt's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.\n\nDrupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed.
